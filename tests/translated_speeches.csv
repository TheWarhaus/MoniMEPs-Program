2024-01-15,17:07:31.807,17:10:52.000,201,Commemoration of Jacques Delors,"Chers collègues, le 27 décembre 2023, l'Europe a perdu un géant politique, un visionnaire, un pionnier. C'est en tant que nouveau président de la Commission européenne que Jacques Delors s'est présenté devant cette assemblée en janvier 1985. Mais notre hémicycle n'était pas nouveau pour lui. En 1979, lors des premières élections européennes, il a été élu membre du Parlement européen, où il a présidé pendant deux ans la commission des affaires économiques et monétaires. Après avoir été ministre des Finances en France entre 1981 et 1984, Jacques Delors revient en Europe à un moment de grande instabilité géopolitique. Conscient des défis à relever, il y voit une opportunité pour l'Europe de s'unir dans la paix et la démocratie. Jacques Delors croyait en une Europe fondée sur une concurrence qui stimule, une coopération qui renforce et une solidarité qui rassemble. C'était un visionnaire européen doté d'un fort esprit pragmatique et d'un sens aigu du détail. L'histoire retiendra Jacques Delors comme le principal architecte de cette extraordinaire décennie d'intégration européenne. On ne peut parler de l'Union européenne d'aujourd'hui sans tenir compte de l'immense impact qu'il a eu sur elle. Aujourd'hui, l'Union européenne se trouve à nouveau à un moment décisif de renouvellement, de changement et de réformes. Le relais nous a été transmis. Puisse la vision de Jacques Delors continuer à nous guider dans notre quête d'une Union pacifique, démocratique, prospère et toujours plus proche. Honorons sa mémoire en préservant son héritage. Chers collègues, en hommage à la vie et à l'héritage extraordinaires du Président Jacques Delors, je vous invite à observer une minute de silence. Je vous remercie.",118859,Roberta Metsola,,,"Dear colleagues, on December 27, 2023, Europe lost a political giant, a visionary, a pioneer.It was as a new president of the European Commission that Jacques Delors appeared before this assembly in January 1985. But our hemicycle was not new to him.In 1979, during the first European elections, he was elected member of the European Parliament, where he chaired the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for two years.After being Minister of Finance in France between 1981 and 1984, Jacques Delors returned to Europe at a time of great geopolitical instability.Aware of the challenges to be met, he sees it as an opportunity for Europe to unite in peace and democracy.Jacques Delors believed in a Europe based on competition that stimulates, a cooperation that strengthens and a solidarity that brings together.It was a European visionary endowed with a strong pragmatic spirit and a sharp sense of detail.History will remember Jacques Delors as the main architect of this extraordinary decade of European integration.We cannot speak of the European Union today without taking into account the immense impact he had on her.Today, the European Union is again at a decisive moment in renewal, change and reforms.The relay was transmitted to us.May Jacques Delors' vision continue to guide us in our quest for a peaceful, democratic, prosperous and always closer union.Let us honor his memory by preserving his inheritance.Dear colleagues, in tribute to the extraordinary life and heritage of President Jacques Delors, I invite you to observe a minute of silence.Thank you."
2024-01-15,17:10:51.157,17:13:44.000,173,Commemoration of Jacques Delors,"Madam President, dear colleagues, today we are looking back at the life and legacy of Jacques Delors, an honorary citizen of Europe. Almost a century of life, a century in Europe, a century in which Europe has fundamentally changed – for the better, I say – and Jacques Delors had a big role to play in this. In the aftermath of the Second World War, Jacques Delors witnessed how the founding fathers of the European Union have given their hands and understood that hope over hate and fear, unity over division, and peace over war are the solutions for a better life in Europe. This is what Jacques Delors also believed in – witnessing himself the first steps of European integration. Staying on the shoulders of the founding fathers, he took Europe to the next stage of integration. We owe him the freedoms of movement, of people, of goods, of services and of capital in the European Union – what we call today the single market, the internal market. This was a flagship project of Commission President Jacques Delors, and it allows us all to live wherever we want in Europe, to work wherever we want in Europe, and it allows young people to study wherever they want in Europe. We owe to him the Erasmus programme. We also owe to him the organisation of the budget of the European Union in seven-year programmes, giving predictability and meaning to European policies. And he also created cohesion policy as we know it today. And we owe to him a lot of decisive steps towards the creation of the euro. All these make Europe more tangible. The legacy of Jacques Delors is bringing Europe closer to the individual, closer to the citizen. The legacy is making Europe relevant for each of us. A Europe that matters, that improves our lives; a Europe that is concrete; a Europe that we can witness and feel every day. It is a big legacy. For this, he was made an honorary citizen of Europe. This is a legacy that we all have the duty to preserve and to protect and to further develop, as Jacques Delors did himself with Europe – further develop it. We shall make sure that we create a European Union that is relevant for the next generations, as he created a European Union that is relevant and helpful for our generation.

2024-01-15,17:13:50.826,17:16:20.000,150,Commemoration of Jacques Delors,"Señora presidenta, la Unión en la que vivimos es la Unión de Jacques Delors. Nunca un presidente de la Comisión Europea ha dejado una huella tan profunda en la construcción del proyecto europeo. Jacques Delors es el hombre comprometido con la paz, porque siempre tuvo presente a su padre, herido grave en la Primera Guerra Mundial; el socialdemócrata convencido de ampliar nuestra Unión y de garantizar la cohesión y una distribución de la riqueza justa entre los pueblos europeos; el visionario que quería más Europa porque creía en la democracia, en los ideales de justicia e igualdad y en nuestro poder cuando actuamos unidos. Es el líder que afrontó con valentía cada desafío: de la crisis del petróleo al mercado interior, de las turbulencias monetarias al euro y de la caída del muro a la reunificación alemana y continental. Señorías, la mejor manera de rendir homenaje a Jacques Delors no es solo recordar sus logros. Ahora que hay amenazas que ponen en peligro su legado, debemos explicar a nuestros ciudadanos por qué somos europeístas y por qué Europa es nuestra esperanza, nuestro futuro y nuestro destino. Somos europeístas porque nuestra larga historia de guerras salvajes nos ha enseñado que los conflictos deben resolverse pacíficamente, lo que es indispensable en un mundo sin paz. Somos europeístas porque compartimos los valores de la democracia, el Estado de derecho, la igualdad de género y la protección de las minorías. Somos europeístas porque nuestra economía social de mercado, que garantiza crecimiento económico y cohesión social, es la mejor fuente de progreso. Somos europeístas porque queremos que nuestros países hagan valer su poder frente a retos como el cambio climático, la transformación digital, la evasión fiscal o las ansias imperiales del criminal Putin. En definitiva, somos europeístas porque la historia nos demuestra que, después de cada crisis, nuestra Unión sale más integrada y unida. Somos europeístas y debemos serlo más en el futuro, porque, como nos decía Jacques Delors, «Europa es una construcción que hay que reinventar constantemente».",28298,Iratxe García Pérez,S-D,au nom du groupe,"Mrs. President, the union in which we live is the union of Jacques Delors.Never a president of the European Commission has left such a deep mark on the construction of the European project.Jacques Delors is the man committed to peace, because he always had his father in mind, seriously injured in World War I;the social democrat convinced to expand our union and guarantee cohesion and a distribution of fair wealth among European peoples;The visionary who wanted more Europe because he believed in democracy, in the ideals of justice and equality and in our power when we act together.He is the leader who raised each challenge with courage: from the oil crisis to the internal market, of the monetary turbulence to the euro and the fall of the wall to the German and continental reunification.Lords, the best way to pay tribute to Jacques Delors is not just to remember his achievements.Now that there are threats that endanger their legacy, we must explain to our citizens why we are Europeanists and why Europe is our hope, our future and our destiny.We are Europeanist because our long history of wild wars has taught us that conflicts must be peacefully resolved, which is indispensable in a world without peace.We are Europeanist because we share the values ​​of democracy, the rule of law, gender equality and the protection of minorities.We are Europeanist because our social market economy, which guarantees economic growth and social cohesion, is the best source of progress.We are European because we want our countries to assert their power against challenges such as climate change, digital transformation, tax evasion or the imperial desire of the Putin criminal.In short, we are Europeanist because history shows us that, after each crisis, our union comes out more integrated and united.We are Europeanists and we must be more in the future, because, as Jacques Delors told us, ""Europe is a construction that must be constantly reinvented."""

The European Union has many successes, but the single market remains the biggest so far. Mr Delors also believed that Europe needed a soul and a human face. Today, people feel insecure and a loss of control. Europe must listen to their concerns and act upon it – on migration, on the economy.

2024-01-15,17:18:48.523,17:21:22.000,154,Commemoration of Jacques Delors,"Madame la Présidente, chers collègues, c'est pour un grand bâtisseur de l'Europe que je prononce aujourd'hui mon premier discours en français dans cet hémicycle. Jacques Delors était un homme politique visionnaire et un Européen convaincu. Il a permis la construction de nouvelles étapes pour avancer vers une Europe unie, une Europe plus juste et plus démocratique. Nous vivons dans un moment historique où l'unité de l'Europe est menacée. Elle est pourtant plus indispensable que jamais pour répondre aux défis de notre époque. On a parfois l'impression qu'à Berlin, mais aussi à Paris ou depuis d'autres capitales européennes, il n'y a que des mots sur cette unité. Mais c'est dans les actes, comme Jacques Delors l'a fait, que l'on peut construire l'Europe de demain. Je suis sûre qu'une Europe forte et unie est aujourd'hui la meilleure stratégie pour notre sécurité, et probablement la seule qui soit durable, pour la protection de notre démocratie, de nos droits fondamentaux ou encore pour faire face au dérèglement climatique. La capacité d'agir ensemble sur ces grands chantiers est le grand défi de notre temps. En nous inspirant de la clairvoyance et de l'engagement de Jacques Delors, nous pouvons y parvenir. Und lassen Sie mich noch auf Deutsch sagen: Ich bin jetzt seit zehn Jahren in diesem Parlament, und in der Europäischen Union scheint es mir immer so, dass Dinge unmöglich sind, bis sie dann irgendwann getan werden. Genauso hat Jacques Delors Politik gemacht. Genauso hat er die Europäische Union und den europäischen Integrationsprozess vorangebracht. Ich wünsche mir, dass genau das der Spirit ist, mit dem auch wir in den nächsten Monaten und nächsten Jahren in der Europäischen Union Politik machen werden. Merci, Jacques Delors. Danke, Jacques Delors. Thank you very much. Rest in peace.",103381,Terry Reintke,Verts/ALE,au nom du groupe,"Madam President, dear colleagues, it is for a great builder of Europe that I give my first speech in French today in this hemicycle.Jacques Delors was a visionary politician and a convinced European.It allowed the construction of new steps to advance to a united Europe, a fairer and more democratic Europe.We live in a historic moment when the unity of Europe is threatened.However, it is more essential than ever to meet the challenges of our time.We sometimes have the impression that in Berlin, but also in Paris or from other European capitals, there are only words on this unit.But it is in acts, as Jacques Delors did, that we can build the Europe of tomorrow.I am sure that a strong and united Europe is today the best strategy for our security, and probably the only one that is sustainable, for the protection of our democracy, our fundamental rights or even to deal with climate change.The ability to act together on these major projects is the great challenge of our time.By inspiring ourselves from the clairvoyance and the commitment of Jacques Delors, we can achieve it.Und lassen sie mich noch auf deutsch sagen: ich bin jetzt seit zehn jahren in diesem parlament, und in der Europäischen union Scheint es mir immer so, dass dinge unmöglich sind, bis sie dann irgendwann Getan wertan.Genauso Hat Jacques Delors Politik Gemacht.Genauso Hat er Die Europäische Union und den Europäischen integrationsprozess Vorangebracht.Ich Wünsche Mir, Dass Genau Das Der Spirit Ist, Mit Dem Wir in Den Nächsten Monaten und Nächsten Jahren in Der Europäischen Union Politik Machen Warden.Thank you, Jacques Delors.Danke, Jacques Delors.Thank You Very Much.Rest in Peace."
2024-01-15,17:21:02.679,17:23:33.000,151,Commemoration of Jacques Delors,"Signor Presidente, onorevoli colleghi, tra coloro che oggi prendono la parola per commemorare Jacques Delors, io sono probabilmente uno dei più distanti politicamente da lui, ma ciò non mi impedisce di tributargli il giusto rispetto umano, né mi impedisce di valutare positivamente alcuni tratti della sua esperienza politica sul piano europeo e nazionale. Prima di tutto mi piace sottolineare l'ancoraggio del suo impegno pubblico ad una dimensione spirituale, religiosa, cristiana. Un aspetto, questo della fede, che era ben presente trasversalmente tra tutti i padri fondatori dell'Unione europea, ma che invece oggi viene bandito dal discorso pubblico, soprattutto tra i socialisti, consentitemelo. Come se essere sinceramente cristiani possa essere di ostacolo alla laicità delle istituzioni o al rispetto di qualunque altra confessione religiosa. Ci sono risultati preziosi della sua attività politica che mi piace evidenziare come la creazione del mercato unico, la libera circolazione di beni e persone all'interno del nostro continente, il lancio del programma studentesco Erasmus, o la particolare attenzione alla politica agricola ed energetica comune. D'altra parte, c'è un elemento nella sua visione che fa da spartiacque rispetto alla nostra visione: l'Unione europea come una Federazione di Stati nazionali. Secondo noi si tratta di un evidente ossimoro, implicitamente ammesso dallo stesso Delors quando ha definito questo Parlamento come ""il primo e unico Parlamento multinazionale al mondo"". Ciò detto, resta intatta la possibilità per il nostro gruppo politico di convergere sulla necessità, più volte ribadita dallo stesso Delors, di riempire quest'Europa con un'anima, altrimenti sarà solo un insieme di uffici e di regole, distante dalla gente e dalla storia.",197820,Nicola Procaccini,ECR,au nom du groupe,"Mr. President, honorable colleagues, among those who today take the floor to commemorate Jacques Delors, I am probably one of the most distant politically from him, but this does not prevent me from paying him the right human respect, nor does it prevent me from positively evaluating some sections of thehis political experience on the European and national level.First of all I like to underline the anchoring of his public commitment to a spiritual, religious, Christian dimension.One aspect, this of faith, which was well present transversely among all the founding fathers of the European Union, but which instead is now banned from public speech, especially among the socialists, allowed it.As if being sincerely Christians can be an obstacle to the secularism of the institutions or to respect any other religious confession.There are precious results of his political activity that I like to highlight how the creation of the single market, the free movement of goods and people within our continent, the launch of the Erasmus student program, or the particular attention to the common agricultural and energy policy.On the other hand, there is an element in its vision that acts as a watershed with respect to our vision: the European Union as a federation of national states.In our opinion, it is an evident oxymoron, implicitly admitted by Delors himself when he defined this parliament as ""the first and only multinational parliament in the world"".That said, the possibility for our political group to converge on the necessity, repeatedly reiterated by Delors, of filling this Europe with a soul, will remain intact, otherwise it will be only a set of offices and rules, far from people and thehistory."
2024-01-15,17:23:34.918,17:25:54.000,140,Commemoration of Jacques Delors,"Madame la Présidente, mes chers collègues, ce Parlement oublie trop souvent les racines de notre culture européenne. Le génie romain, par exemple, nous a légué cette formule pleine de sagesse: de mortuis nil nisi bonum , c'est à dire «des morts, rien que du bien». Les rêves de Jacques Delors n'étaient pas les nôtres. Là où il voyait une économie libérée, nous craignons des marchés en danger. Ce qu'il appelait le «projet européen» conduisait pour nous immanquablement à l'effacement des nations. Enfin, là où il envisageait la fluidité des déplacements des Européens avec un Schengen, nous alertons sur les périls de la réduction des frontières. Ces antagonismes sont pourtant autant d'hommages à un homme qui a façonné l'Union européenne. L'Union européenne dans laquelle nous vivons, qu'on l'apprécie ou qu'on la critique, a été largement façonnée par celui qui fut le président de la Commission pendant dix ans. Lauréat du prix Charlemagne, il fut couronné par ses pairs qui saluèrent en lui l'ouvrier industrieux d'un projet nouveau. C'est peu dire que les Français, quelle que soit leur orientation politique, ont les pires difficultés du monde à apprendre la grammaire des institutions européennes. Nous pouvons tous reconnaître que Jacques Delors en assimila le langage, les codes et la psychologie avec une acuité qui force l'admiration. N'oublions pas que, jeune collaborateur de Jacques Chaban-Delmas, Jacques Delors travailla au projet de la nouvelle société. Il défendit – et c'est tout à son honneur – l'idée d'une Europe sociale à la fin de son engagement européen. La cohérence d'un homme, quelles que soient ses convictions, mérite le respect de ceux qui l'ont combattu. Jacques Delors a quitté ce monde et n'appartient donc plus à l'arène européenne. Il a rejoint la longue cohorte des Français qui ont marqué l'histoire de notre continent. La loyauté à sa mémoire s'impose désormais à tous. L'ancien syndicaliste nous demandait certainement de veiller à ce qu'aucune de nos décisions n'oublie ceux qui ploient sous les souffrances économiques. Ce sera la meilleure manière pour ses anciens adversaires, comme ses nombreux amis, d'honorer sa mémoire.",236051,Eric Minardi,ID,au nom du groupe,"Madam President, my dear colleagues, this Parliament too often forgets the roots of our European culture.The Roman genius, for example, bequeathed to us this formula full of wisdom: from Mortuis Nil Nisi Bonum, that is to say ""of the dead, nothing but good"".Jacques Delors' dreams were not ours.Where he saw a released economy, we fear markets in danger.What he called the ""European project"" was inevitably led to the erasure of nations.Finally, where he envisaged the fluidity of Europeans' movements with a diagram, we alert to the perils of border reduction.These antagonisms are as many tributes to a man who shaped the European Union.The European Union in which we live, to be appreciated or criticized, was largely shaped by the one who was the president of the commission for ten years.Winner of the Charlemagne Prize, he was crowned by his peers who greeted in him the industrial worker of a new project.It is an understatement to say that the French, whatever their political orientation, have the worst difficulties of the world to learn the grammar of European institutions.We can all recognize that Jacques Delors assimilated language, codes and psychology with acuity that forces admiration.Let us not forget that, a young collaborator of Jacques Chaban-Delmas, Jacques Delors worked on the new company's project.He defended - and it was everything in his honor - the idea of ​​a social Europe at the end of his European commitment.The coherence of a man, whatever his convictions, deserves respect for those who fought him.Jacques Delors has left this world and therefore no longer belongs to the European arena.He joined the long cohort of the French who marked the history of our continent.Loyalty to his memory is now imposed on everyone.The former trade unionist certainly asked us to ensure that none of our decisions forget those who pluck under economic sufferings.It will be the best way for his former opponents, like her many friends, to honor his memory."
2024-01-15,17:25:56.334,17:28:12.000,136,Commemoration of Jacques Delors,"Madame la Présidente, Monsieur le Commissaire, chers collègues, ce moment de commémoration est l'occasion de revenir sur les décisions qui ont été prises pendant tout le temps où Jacques Delors a présidé la Commission européenne entre 1985 et 1995, car ces décisions façonnent l'architecture de l'Europe d'aujourd'hui. Jacques Delors estimait, comme la grande majorité des dirigeants politiques de l'époque, que la relance de la construction européenne devait passer avant tout par l'approfondissement des logiques de marché et que, certes, le social était important, mais que l'harmonisation sociale adviendrait naturellement une fois l'allégeance faite au dogme de la concurrence. Au lieu de l'Europe sociale, on a eu droit à l'Europe brutale, l'Europe qui fait mal: austérité, libre-échange, acte unique et pensée unique, Maastricht, toujours plus de sacro-sainte concurrence, délocalisations en pagaille. L'expérience nous a montré que le social n'a pas découlé spontanément du marché et que, si nous voulons du social en Europe, il faut de la volonté politique, il faut des décisions concrètes en la matière. Mais alors, certains, parmi les plus fervents défenseurs du libéralisme, paniquent dès qu'ils se retrouvent face à un texte européen qui pourrait améliorer la vie des travailleurs. Ce sont d'ailleurs les mêmes qui se revendiquent les héritiers de Jacques Delors dans la volonté de relancer une construction européenne et qui font obstacle aux textes qui améliorent la vie des travailleurs au niveau européen. Pour le dire clairement, je rage d'entendre des dirigeants comme Emmanuel Macron se positionner sur la scène nationale en grand défenseur d'une Europe qui protège et en même temps de voir ce même Emmanuel Macron, ici, au niveau européen, s'acharner à faire tomber une directive qui devrait donner quelques droits aux travailleurs des plateformes, tout cela pour ne pas heurter les intérêts d'Uber. Dans quelques mois auront lieu les élections européennes. Croyez-moi, nous allons faire en sorte que les citoyens européens sachent que ceux qui se vantent d'être les plus pro-Europe sont en réalité ceux qui bloquent les avancées qui pourraient améliorer la vie de millions d'Européens. Aux défenseurs les plus zélés de la construction européenne, je le dis: en reprenant les dogmes de l'Europe brutale, c'est la destruction européenne que vous obtiendrez.",197529,Leila Chaibi,The Left,au nom du groupe,"Madam President, the Commissioner, Dear colleagues, this moment of commemoration is an opportunity to return to the decisions which were taken during the whole time when Jacques Delors presided over the European Commission between 1985 and 1995, because these decisions shape the'Architecture of Europe today.Jacques Delors estimated, like the vast majority of political leaders of the time, that the revival of European construction had to go above all through the deepening of market logics and that, certainly, the social was important, but that harmonizationsocial would naturally come to the allegiance made to the dogma of competition.Instead of social Europe, we were entitled to brutal Europe, Europe which hurts: austerity, free trade, unique act and unique thought, Maastricht, always more sacrosanct competition, relocations in mess.Experience has shown us that the social has not spontaneously resulted in the market and that, if we want social in Europe, it takes political will, it takes concrete decisions in the matter.But then, some, among the most fervent defenders of liberalism, panic as soon as they find themselves faced with a European text which could improve the lives of workers.They are the same who claim to be the heirs of Jacques Delors in the desire to revive a European construction and who obstruct the texts which improve the lives of workers at European level.To put it clearly, I rage to hear leaders like Emmanuel Macron positioning themselves on the national scene as a great defender of a Europe who protects and at the same time to see this same Emmanuel Macron, here, at European level, to be testedTo bring down a directive which should give some rights to the workers of the platforms, all this so as not to hit Uber's interests.In a few months will take place the European elections.Believe me, we will make sure that European citizens know that those who boast of being the most pro-Europe are actually those who block the advances that could improve the lives of millions of Europeans.To the most zealous defenders of European construction, I say: by taking up the dogmas of brutal Europe, it is the European destruction that you will obtain."

2024-01-15,17:28:20.087,17:32:50.000,270,Statements by the President,"First of all, dear colleagues, it is with a deep sense of pride and honour that I inform you that on Saturday I was in Vilnius to receive on behalf of all MEPs and the European Parliament, the Freedom Prize from the Republic of Lithuania. It was a moving and emotional moment and I was glad to be there in your name to witness it. This prize is for all of you and your work in support of peace, democracy, human rights and freedom. It is in recognition of what our Parliament does. May it serve to continue to inspire our actions. Dear colleagues, in the spirit of defending freedom, I need to refer again to what is happening in Belarus, still controlled by Europe’s last dictator. Activists, innocent people are still being detained arbitrarily. The number of political prisoners continues to grow. We cannot allow it to fall off the top of our agenda. That is why I have met with Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya last week and promised to do what we can to support political prisoners and urge their release. For that reason I have agreed to join their campaign and became a so-called ‘godparent’ of Palina Sharenda-Panasyuk, a mother, an activist, sentenced in 2021 and then in 2022 by Lukashenko’s regime to four years in prison on trumped‑up charges. Palina has been beaten, placed in a punishment cell, and refused medicines and access to her family or a lawyer. My appeal to all of you who have not yet done so is to join the campaign and consider adding your voice too. Dear colleagues, last year, you will recall, the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to Jina Mahsa Amini and the Woman, Life, Freedom Movement. However, a few days before they were scheduled to receive their award, the Iranian regime placed Ms Mahsa Amini’s family under a travel ban – a stark example of the type of treatment that the people of Iran are faced with every day. On 12 December, this House welcomed Mr Saleh Nikbakht, the Amini family lawyer, to receive the Sakharov Prize on their behalf. Shortly after his return to Iran, Mr Saleh Nikbakht was arrested and the award was confiscated. According to our information, Mr Saleh Nikbakht has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for allegedly engaging in ‘propaganda against the system’. It is a false charge. It is unacceptable. It is inexcusable, and this House condemns it. I want to recognise that bravery and commitment by Mr Saleh Nikbakht. He spoke eloquently and courageously. On behalf of the European Parliament, I call for the immediate and unconditional release of Mr Saleh Nikbakht. I will also take this opportunity to reiterate our unwavering support to Mahsa Amini’s family and the Woman, Life, Freedom Movement in their ceaseless fight for liberty, justice and human rights. You are not alone. Dear colleagues, on 21 December 2023 we witnessed a horrific – the worst – mass shooting in Czechia when a gunman in Prague shot dead 14 people at the Charles University and injured many more. It pains us to think of the many families that were forced to mourn their loved ones at a time of peace and togetherness. My thoughts are with them and with the victims of these brutal attacks, who are still recovering. Evropa stojí při Česku. *** Before we move to the approval of the minutes of the previous sitting, is there a point of order?",118859,Roberta Metsola,,,"First of all, dear colleagues, it is with a deep sense of pride and honour that I inform you that on Saturday I was in Vilnius to receive on behalf of all MEPs and the European Parliament, the Freedom Prize from the Republic of Lithuania. It was a moving and emotional moment and I was glad to be there in your name to witness it. This prize is for all of you and your work in support of peace, democracy, human rights and freedom. It is in recognition of what our Parliament does. May it serve to continue to inspire our actions. Dear colleagues, in the spirit of defending freedom, I need to refer again to what is happening in Belarus, still controlled by Europe’s last dictator. Activists, innocent people are still being detained arbitrarily. The number of political prisoners continues to grow. We cannot allow it to fall off the top of our agenda. That is why I have met with Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya last week and promised to do what we can to support political prisoners and urge their release. For that reason I have agreed to join their campaign and became a so-called ‘godparent’ of Palina Sharenda-Panasyuk, a mother, an activist, sentenced in 2021 and then in 2022 by Lukashenko’s regime to four years in prison on trumped‑up charges. Palina has been beaten, placed in a punishment cell, and refused medicines and access to her family or a lawyer. My appeal to all of you who have not yet done so is to join the campaign and consider adding your voice too. Dear colleagues, last year, you will recall, the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to Jina Mahsa Amini and the Woman, Life, Freedom Movement. However, a few days before they were scheduled to receive their award, the Iranian regime placed Ms Mahsa Amini’s family under a travel ban – a stark example of the type of treatment that the people of Iran are faced with every day. On 12 December, this House welcomed Mr Saleh Nikbakht, the Amini family lawyer, to receive the Sakharov Prize on their behalf. Shortly after his return to Iran, Mr Saleh Nikbakht was arrested and the award was confiscated.

Perché, vedete, il pericolo per i nostri cittadini non proviene certo da chi ogni anno commemora eccidi efferati come quello di Acca Larentia, ma anche di Primavalle, di Sergio Ramelli e di Fausto e Iaio e di tante altre vittime a destra e a sinistra degli anni di piombo.

This should be added to the agenda on Wednesday afternoon after the topical debate. Consequently, the session should be extended until 23.00. And why? Because Norway’s decision to advance seabed mining in the Arctic is very destructive for the vulnerable Arctic environment, even at the exploration phase.

This should be added to the agenda on Wednesday afternoon after the topical debate. Consequently, the session should be extended until 23.00. And why? Because Norway’s decision to advance seabed mining in the Arctic is very destructive for the vulnerable Arctic environment, even at the exploration phase. This kind of activity could potentially start a global race to mine the ocean floor, which it is essential to contain.

2024-01-15,18:00:00.030,18:04:09.000,249,Ozone depleting substances - Fluorinated gases regulation (joint debate - Gas emissions),"Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren, Herr Präsident, sehr geehrter Herr Kommissar! Umwelt- und Klimaschutz durch moderne Technik und in Zusammenarbeit mit den Betroffenen – so würde ich die Arbeit überschreiben, die wir bei den beiden vorliegenden Berichten gemacht haben. Ich vertrete heute die Berichterstatterin Jessica Polfjärd und möchte ihr gratulieren zu einem Bericht, der ohne große Kontroversen durch den Umweltausschuss und das Plenum und durch den Trilog gegangen ist. Danke an alle Beteiligten, die dabei geholfen haben. Bei dem Bericht Polfjärd geht es um ozonzerstörende Substanzen. Wir hatten ein Riesenproblem mit dem Ozonloch in den 80ern. Als Arzt weiß ich, dass Hautkrebs durch das Ozonloch sehr, sehr stark zugenommen hat. Wir haben das Problem mittlerweile sehr gut im Griff durch ein internationales Abkommen und durch den Ersatz dieser Stoffe, die das Ozonloch verursachen. Es gibt jetzt noch wenige Bereiche, in denen diese Substanzen noch erlaubt sind: in der Medizin zum Beispiel. Hier sieht das Abkommen stärkere Kontrolle vor, und wir wollen eine sichere Rückgewinnung und Verwertung dieser Stoffe. Bei Baumaterialien, auch beim Abriss von Gebäuden, muss stärker darauf geachtet werden, dass die Substanzen nicht in die Atmosphäre kommen. Und auch die Leaks müssen besser kontrolliert werden. Ich denke, bei beiden Berichten – und ich werde jetzt auch noch mal etwas zum F-Gas- Bericht sagen – haben wir es geschafft, moderne Technik zu unterstützen, die uns helfen kann bei der Bekämpfung von Umweltproblemen. F-Gase sind bis zu 25 000 Mal klimaschädlicher als CO2, und deswegen haben wir hier eine Baustelle. Die Verordnung zu den F-Gasen ermöglicht es uns, so viel CO2 einzusparen – 40 Millionen Tonnen CO2-Äquivalent–, wie Irland, Portugal und Schweden jährlich emittieren oder auch eine Anzahl von sehr, sehr vielen PKW. Das ist für den Klimaschutz schon ein ganz, ganz wichtiger Schritt. Viele EU Firmen haben die alternativen natürlichen Kältemittel, die wir brauchen, um die Funktion weiter darzustellen. Und deswegen ist das auch für große Teile der Industrie eine gute Lösung. Wir hatten aber eine Baustelle: Nach dem Beschluss des Umweltausschusses hat sich zu Recht das Handwerk beschwert. Ich sage es hier ganz klar: Wir müssen auf die Interessen des Handwerks Rücksicht nehmen. Ohne Handwerk gibt es keine Energiewende. Das Problem war, dass wir bei der Reparatur von Geräten und beim Thema Ersatzteile beispielsweise oder bei der Frage, wenn ein bestehendes Gerät nicht mehr funktioniert und man F-Gase hineinbringen muss, damit es wieder funktioniert, eine viel zu kurze Übergangsfrist im Umweltausschuss gehabt haben. 2024 sollte da schon ein Verbot greifen – wir sind schon in 2024. Deswegen bin ich sehr dankbar, dass das Plenum die Änderungsanträge – einen von der EVP mit der Renew zusammen und einen nur von der EVP – zu diesem Thema angenommen hat, sodass das Handwerk Planungssicherheit hat und bestehende Anlagen nicht wertlos werden. Ich glaube, am Ende ist das ein gutes Ergebnis – Klima- und Umweltschutz mit dem Handwerk und mit der Industrie.",1927,Peter Liese,,rapporteur suppleant,"Dear Sir or Madam, Mr President, Dear Commissioner!Environmental and climate protection through modern technology and in cooperation with those affected- so I would overwrite the work that we have made in the two reports.Today I represent the rapporteur Jessica Polfjärd and would like to congratulate her on a report that went through the environmental committee and the plenary and the trilogue without great controversy.Thanks to everyone involved who helped.The Polfjärd report deals with ozone -disturbing substances.We had a huge problem with the ozone hole in the 80s.As a doctor, I know that skin cancer has increased very, very strongly through the ozone hole.We now have the problem very well under control by an international agreement and by replacing these substances that cause the ozone hole.There are now few areas in which these substances are still allowed: in medicine, for example.Here the agreement provides for greater control and we want a safe recovery and recycling of these substances.In the case of building materials, also when demolishing buildings, care must be taken to ensure that the substances do not come into the atmosphere.And the leaks also have to be better checked.I think with both reports- and I will now say something about the F-gas report- we have managed to support modern technology that can help us combat environmental problems.F-gases are up to 25,000 times more climate-damaging than CO2, and that's why we have a construction site here.The Ordinance on the F-Gases enables us to save so much CO2-40 million tons of CO2 equivalent-such as Ireland, Portugal and Sweden issue every year or a number of very, very many cars.This is a very, very important step for climate protection.Many EU companies have the alternatives of natural refrigerants that we need to further display the function.And that's why this is a good solution for large parts of the industry.But we had a construction site: According to the decision of the environmental committee, the craft rightly complained.I say it very clearly here: we have to consider the interests of the craft.There is no energy transition without craft.The problem was that when it comes to repairing devices and when it comes to repairing spare parts, for example or when it comes to the question, if an existing device no longer works and you have to bring F-Gase in so that it works again, a much too short transition period in the environmental committee.In 2024 there should be a ban - we are already in 2024. That is why I am very grateful that the plenary has accepted the change applications - one of the EVP with the Renew and one only from the EVP - so that the craftPlanning security has and does not become worthless.I think this is a good result- climate and environmental protection with the craft and industry."
2024-01-15,18:04:13.405,18:08:08.000,235,Ozone depleting substances - Fluorinated gases regulation (joint debate - Gas emissions),"Mr President, we are tomorrow going to vote on the revision of the F-Gas Regulation, which indeed I think is a very good example of a regulation that is improving our circumstances for our environment, but at the same time improving European competitiveness and European industry. First of all, I really would like to thank all the shadows for their negotiations and their support, and of course also the Council and the Commission for all their work in achieving this compromise. The F-Gas Regulation is existing, of course. The current one was already reducing our F-gas emissions and, just reminding, F-gases are very potent greenhouse gases. So, in the number of molecules we don't emit as much CO2, but some of those have an impact on the global warming potential, even up to 24 000. So that means one molecule has 24 000 times more of an impact on global warming than one molecule of CO2. So, this is the low-hanging fruit that we need to achieve. Already the existing regulation is reducing the use and the emissions of F-gases – and more or less two thirds of that is being reduced – with this regulation and achieving zero emissions by 2050, it means that all the F-gases will be out of our economy and will be replaced by natural alternatives, and that is a very clear prospect for all the investors from now on. If you are working on heat pumps and conditioning cooling systems, you know where to go to. You need to invest in the natural alternatives, and that is the very clear point to go to. This is also one of the first sectors that is then really achieving zero emissions that we have promised to achieve for the entire economy by 2050. In that sense, I think it's another good example of how this law can work. Of course, there were considerations and concerns about the heat pumps, which of course also demands a fast acceleration. I think, thanks to the negotiations with Council and my colleagues and the Commission, we have had a good compromise that is giving a clear signal also for the market, certainly for the heat pumps for consumers, but at the same time also making sure that this acceleration of expansion of heat pumps can be achieved. Also part of the concern was that if we are moving from F-gases with lower potential, we could be moving to chemicals that fall under the category of PFAs. I think that also gives you another very clear example, that  moving to the natural alternatives in some of these applications is very important. Maybe a very last point. This sector is having innovation mainly within Europe. If we are looking at the use of F-gases, it is mainly done by non-European industrial players. It's the European industrial players that are investing in the natural alternatives and are ahead of the game. So this regulation and this revision of the regulation is a support for European innovation, for achieving natural alternatives. And that not only makes this a very good environmental law, but it also makes it a very strong law for European competitiveness. I think that is a very important message to give, that environmental legislation can go hand in hand with good economic regulation. So with that, I would like to thank everyone, and I hope for a good approval tomorrow in the plenary. I'm looking forward to then the implementation by the Commission, to move as fast as possible to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and in this sector to achieve zero emissions by 2050.",96725,Bas Eickhout,,rapporteur,"Mr President, we are tomorrow going to vote on the revision of the F-Gas Regulation, which indeed I think is a very good example of a regulation that is improving our circumstances for our environment, but at the same time improving European competitiveness and European industry.

Already the existing regulation is reducing the use and the emissions of F-gases – and more or less two thirds of that is being reduced – with this regulation and achieving zero emissions by 2050, it means that all the F-gases will be out of our economy and will be replaced by natural alternatives, and that is a very clear prospect for all the investors from now on. If you are working on heat pumps and conditioning cooling systems, you know where to go to. You need to invest in the natural alternatives, and that is the very clear point to go to. This is also one of the first sectors that is then really achieving zero emissions that we have promised to achieve for the entire economy by 2050. In that sense, I think it's another good example of how this law can work. Of course, there were considerations and concerns about the heat pumps, which of course also demands a fast acceleration. I think, thanks to the negotiations with Council and my colleagues and the Commission, we have had a good compromise that is giving a clear signal also for the market, certainly for the heat pumps for consumers, but at the same time also making sure that this acceleration of expansion of heat pumps can be achieved. Also part of the concern was that if we are moving from F-gases with lower potential, we could be moving to chemicals that fall under the category of PFAs. I think that also gives you another very clear example, that  moving to the natural alternatives in some of these applications is very important. Maybe a very last point. This sector is having innovation mainly within Europe. If we are looking at the use of F-gases, it is mainly done by non-European industrial players. It's the European industrial players that are investing in the natural alternatives and are ahead of the game. So this regulation and this revision of the regulation is a support for European innovation, for achieving natural alternatives. And that not only makes this a very good environmental law, but it also makes it a very strong law for European competitiveness. I think that is a very important message to give, that environmental legislation can go hand in hand with good economic regulation. So with that, I would like to thank everyone, and I hope for a good approval tomorrow in the plenary. I'm looking forward to then the implementation by the Commission, to move as fast as possible to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and in this sector to achieve zero emissions by 2050."

I thank the two rapporteurs for their work on making this agreement possible. It is an ambitious agreement that will decisively contribute to our climate objectives. On F-gases, the new rules before you today will strongly reduce F-gas emissions. This high ambition is great news in view of our climate targets for 2030 and reaching climate neutrality by 2050. In particular, the use of the most important group of F-gases, the HFCs, will be phased out by 2050, and we will strongly reduce other relevant F-gases such as SF6, the strongest known greenhouse gas. This will transform a number of sectors of our economy, including the air conditioning and heat pump sector, the electricity sector using electrical switchgear and the medical sector of asthma sprays, so that they are no longer depending on the highly-warming greenhouse gases. I perfectly join what has been said on how you can combine Europe's competitiveness, industrial competitiveness by improving our environmental approach and also by achieving our objectives. As Parliament demanded, the agreed review ensures that a number of sectors where alternatives are feasible will eventually completely avoid the use of substances that may produce PFAS in the medium term. This is the case of smaller heat pumps. Business as usual is no longer possible, and the European industry has an opportunity to become the first to supply these low-carbon and climate-neutral solutions globally. Already today, we are witnessing that the offer of fully climate-friendly heat pumps and switchgear on the EU market is increasing by the day, and many of these types of equipment are produced here in Europe, with a number of large new plants that have opened in recent months. Not least, this transition will bring significant financial benefits for citizens to with, for instance, more energy savings and less operation costs for many types of equipment, including heat pumps. Turning to the ozone-depleting substances regulation. Going ahead with the successful phase out of ozone-depleting substances is also essential for our climate agenda. Thanks to the Montreal Protocol, we can expect that the ozone hole will recover by approximately 2070 and prevent a major impact in global warming. Up to one degree of climate warming will be prevented by mid-century because of the global elimination of ozone-depleting substances. But these effects are ensured only if there is no backsliding. The EU must continue to lead by example and inspire others in the world to be ambitious. The EU will now be able to capture the large potential to save emissions from old insulation foams in houses for renovation or demolition, a measure that will certainly stimulate the recycling sector.

F-Gase werden in einer Vielzahl an Alltagsprodukten wie Kühlschränken, Klimaanlagen, Wärmepumpen, Asthmasprays, Feuerlöschern – um nur einige zu nennen – eingesetzt. Auch in der Bauwirtschaft oder in Schaltanlagen unserer Stromversorgungssysteme spielen Kältemittel eine wichtige Rolle. Diese synthetischen Kältemittel, die sogenannten F-Gase, besitzen ein alarmierend hohes Treibhauspotenzial, das bis zu 25 000 Mal klimaschädlicher ist als CO2. Daher müssen diese Stoffe drastisch reduziert und mit natürlichen Kältemitteln ersetzt werden, wenn wir den Klimawandel ernsthaft bekämpfen wollen. Mit dem Dossier für F-Gase ist auch die Ozonverordnung eng verknüpft. Gerade bei Ozon haben wir in der Vergangenheit gesehen, dass mit klaren, verbindlichen Regelungen hervorragende Ergebnisse erzielt werden können. Mit dem erfolgreichen Abschluss der interinstitutionellen Verhandlungen stärken wir den Green Deal. In meiner Rolle als Schattenberichterstatter zur Überarbeitung der F-Gas-Verordnung freue ich mich daher, heute berichten zu können, dass wir diesen wichtigen Paradigmenwechsel erfolgreich in Angriff genommen haben. Ein großes Dankeschön an alle Kolleginnen und Kollegen für die wirklich gute und konstruktive Zusammenarbeit, ganz besonders an den Berichterstatter Bas Eickhout. Sowohl die Herstellung als auch der Verbrauch werden nach einem strengen Zeitplan mit abnehmenden Quotenzuweisungen schrittweise reduziert. Was die Quotenzuteilung für den Verbrauch betrifft, werden diese bis 2050 sogar vollständig eingestellt. Der zur Abstimmung vorliegende Text ist ein wichtiger Beitrag zum Klimaschutz und zur Erreichung der Ziele des Pariser Abkommens. Zudem stärkt die überarbeitete Verordnung die führende Rolle europäischer Unternehmen auf den Weltmärkten für klimafreundliche Technologien und macht uns unabhängig von hauptsächlich in den USA und Asien hergestellten F-Gasen. Wir stärken den Industriestandort Europa und sichern heute bereits die Arbeitsplätze von morgen. Berechnungen zufolge würden rund 80 % der F-Gas-Emissionen des Jahres 2050 aus stationären und mobilen Kälte- und Klimaanlagen stammen. Diese Emissionen sind vermeidbar, da sie durch klimafreundliche natürliche Kältemittel ersetzt werden können und auch ersetzt werden. Durch die strengere Regulierung der F-Gas-Verordnung und der ebenfalls zur Abstimmung stehenden Ozonverordnung werden bis 2050 insgesamt 500 Millionen Tonnen CO2 eingespart.

När vi tittar tillbaka på sent 80-tal, när vi började förstå problemet med ett allt tunnare ozonlager, det som vi ofta vid polerna i alla fall brukar beskriva som ett ozonhål. Det vi gjorde då, det brukar ofta lyftas fram som ett gott exempel på hur politik verkligen kan lyssna på vetenskap och ta in de larmrapporter som fanns då. Det som hände var att världens länder kom överens om att vi behövde fasa ut de här farliga ämnena som bryter ned ozonet högt upp i stratosfären många mil upp i atmosfären. Den gången lyssnade vi verkligen på forskningen och tog de här larmrapporterna på fullt allvar. Men vi har mycket att lära av det arbetet, det som hände då. Det är precis den typen av process som vi borde ha i andra miljö- och natur- och klimatfrågor också. Arbetet med Montrealprotokollet som landade sent 80-tal, det är ju inte över, för det är fortfarande en del utsläpp av ämnen som inte regleras, och det kommer in nya ämnen som inte fanns på den tiden. Och det finns dessutom, som några andra talare har sagt också, tydliga kopplingar mellan de här ämnena som bryter ned ozonlagret och klimatfrågan.

Men dessutom har vi den stora problematiken att när växthuseffekten förstärks, blir det varmare här nere vid markytan men samtidigt kallare uppe i stratosfären där ozonskiktet finns. Och fortsätter den avkylningen, finns det en stor risk att läkningen av ozonlagret kommer att ta mycket, mycket längre tid.

Nessuno nega l'attenzione alla tutela ambientale, né critichiamo la ricerca in tecnologie alternative, anzi: le perplessità ancora presenti derivano da molti confronti avuti con gli attori del settore F-Gas. Ribadisco: ridurre i gas serra e cercare soluzioni più sostenibili e naturali nel settore della refrigerazione e delle pompe di calore è la nostra visione. Il problema è l'integralismo proprio di alcune anime di questo Parlamento. Come è possibile chiedere di eliminare gli F-Gas passando a tecnologie più pericolose come i gas infiammabili? Perché alcuni vogliono imporre divieti e scadenze troppo vicine se non ci sono soluzioni tecnologiche disponibili? Per fortuna il Consiglio ha riportato equilibrio rispetto alle previsioni iniziali. Sarà decisivo valutare nel prossimo mandato se questa normativa sarà all'altezza delle aspettative di operatori, attori e ambiente. Due considerazioni. La prima, nell'Unione europea siamo all'avanguardia nella refrigerazione; vogliamo che scelte ideologiche affrettate colpiscano un comparto di eccellenza? Non pensiamo che imprese e lavoratori abbiano bisogno di normative stabili, chiare, che difendano l'ambiente senza tralasciare di difendere il loro business? La seconda: allarghiamo lo sguardo. Pensate veramente che con normative così stringenti e slegate dal contesto tecnologico saremo competitivi nello scenario internazionale? Ci sono già abbastanza pratiche commerciali aggressive intorno a noi; come sostenere produzione e ricerca delle nostre imprese se non creiamo le condizioni idonee? Concludo. Mancano pochi mesi alle elezioni europee, i cittadini ci chiedono sempre più di usare ragione e ponderazione nelle scelte, soprattutto in quelle che toccano la quotidianità.

Das fluorierte Treibhausgas SF6 ist 25 000 Mal schädlicher für die Umwelt als CO2, wenn es in die Atmosphäre gelangt. Allein in unseren europäischen Mittelspannungsnetzen stecken 8 600 Tonnen dieses Gases. Umgerechnet entspricht das dem jährlichen CO2-Ausstoß der Niederlande. Schon 2016 haben wir als EU einen Zusatz zum Montreal-Abkommen unterschrieben, die Produktion und die Anwendung dieser hochklimaschädlichen Gase zu reduzieren. Es ist also höchste Zeit, regulatorisch zu handeln. Es ist auch industriepolitisch klug, denn wir haben in Europa dank unserer Innovationskraft in den letzten Jahren eine Technologie entwickelt, die in der Lage ist, dieses schädliche Gas in den Schaltanlagen unserer Energienetze durch eine nachhaltige Alternative vollständig zu ersetzen. Diese Alternative aus natürlichen Gasen ist ungiftig, patentfrei, wird von mehreren Anbietern in Europa zur Verfügung gestellt und kann ohne großen Aufwand eingesetzt werden. Und am Siemens-Standort Berlin, meine Damen und Herren, wurde das mit am frühesten erkannt, und deshalb ist bei uns die Heimat von SF6-freien Schaltanlagen. In Berlin wurde dank unermüdlicher Forschung und Weiterentwicklung über Jahrzehnte hinweg schlussendlich Geschichte für umweltfreundliche Industrieproduktion geschrieben. Und da die Berliner Technologie auch sofort einsatzbereit ist, hätten wir aus meiner Sicht auch im Hochspannungsbereich und im Zeitplan bei der Abschaffung des SF6-Gases ambitionierter bleiben können. Aber unter dem Strich zählt, dass wir jetzt insgesamt den Weg dafür ebnen, dass diese technologische Erfolgsgeschichte nun auf die EU übertragen werden und die Massenproduktion der Teile mit den neuen, klimaunschädlichen Ersatzgasen beginnen kann. Ein großes Dankeschön an alle Visionäre am Standort Berlin und an alle Kolleginnen und Kollegen in Kommission, Rat und Parlament, die an diesem wichtigen Baustein für ein klimaneutrales Europa mitgewirkt haben!",197408,Hildegard Bentele,PPE,,"President!The fluorinated greenhouse gas SF6 is 25,000 times more harmful to the environment than CO2 if it gets into the atmosphere.In our European medium -voltage networks alone, there are 8,600 tons of this gas.The equivalent of this corresponds to the annual CO2 emissions of the Netherlands.Already in 2016, as an EU, we signed an addition to the Montreal Agreement to reduce production and the use of this high-air-climatic gas.So it is high time to act regulatory.It is also wise industrial policy, because thanks to our innovative strength in Europe, we have developed a technology in recent years that is able to completely replace this harmful gas in the switchgear of our energy networks with a sustainable alternative.This alternative from natural gases is non -toxic, patent -free, is made available in Europe by several providers and can be used without much effort.And at the Siemens location of Berlin, ladies and gentlemen, this was recognized the earliest, and that's why we are home to SF6-free switchgear.In Berlin, thanks to tireless research and further development, history for environmentally friendly industrial production was finally written over decades.And since the Berlin technology is also ready for use, in my view we could have remained more ambitious in the high-voltage area and in the schedule when the SF6 gas was abolished.But the bottom line is that we are now paving the way for this technological success story to be transferred to the EU and the mass production of the parts can begin with the new, harmful replacement gases.A big thank you to all visionaries at the Berlin location and to all colleagues in the Commission, Council and Parliament who participated in this important building block for a climate -neutral Europe!"

Il primo obiettivo è stato quello di favorire e sostenere l'innovazione nei numerosi processi in cui vengono utilizzati gli F-Gas già oggi: per esempio il settore farmaceutico e quello delle tecnologie per il freddo commerciale e industriale si sono dimostrati già fortemente innovativi e sono oggi in grado di raggiungere livelli di performance superiori anche a quelli indicati dalla Commissione nella sua originaria proposta. Soluzioni tecnologiche anche con minore impatto sono disponibili o lo saranno presto. Il secondo punto è stato quello di lavorare per evitare strozzature di mercato, che ci sono già o si stanno profilando, e restrizioni al mercato unico e alla libera circolazione delle merci. Pensiamo che si debba allargare il campo delle alternative disponibili e delle applicazioni per evitare soluzioni monopolistiche, come già ci sono nel settore dei commutatori elettrici. Potrei parlare anche dei pezzi di ricambio, dove noi abbiamo auspicato una maggiore cautela e attenzione perché c'è un problema di disponibilità finanziaria delle famiglie, ma chiudo dicendo che, sebbene non tutte le nostre osservazioni siano state recepite, siamo convinti che questo è un buon provvedimento e lo sosteniamo.",28340,Patrizia Toia,S-D,,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, Ladies colleagues, I would like to briefly illustrate some of the objectives of the contribution that we have given as commission for industry, always working, so I worked, in the belief that the policies of environmental protection that we are pursuing not only are compatibleWith competitiveness, but they can also push the competitiveness of our production system.The first goal was to encourage and support innovation in the numerous processes in which the F-Gas already today are used today: for example, the pharmaceutical sector and that of technologies for commercial and industrial cold have already proven to be strongly innovative and areToday capable of reaching higher performance levels also to those indicated by the Commission in its original proposal.Technological solutions also with less impact are available or will soon be.The second point was to work to avoid marketing of the market, which are already or are profiting, and restrictions on the single market and the free movement of goods.We think that the field of available alternatives and applications should be widening to avoid monopolistic solutions, as are already in the electric switching sector.I could also speak of spare parts, where we have hoped for greater caution and attention because there is a problem of financial availability of families, but I close by saying that although not all our observations have been implemented, we are convinced that this is aGood measure and we support it."

Ce remplacement par des alternatives plus ou moins fiables a été un véritable calvaire car ils sont indispensables pour les équipements de chaleur, les unités frigorifiques ou encore les aérosols. Mais reconnaissons le résultat, ces politiques ont fonctionné. Les gaz fluorés à base de chlore, ces gaz inefficaces et polluants ont été supprimés pour passer à des gaz sans chlore plus efficaces et bien plus propres. La dégradation de la couche d'ozone s'est aussi largement réduite. Nous avions donc un équilibre en Europe: nous utilisions des gaz sans chlore, favorisant autant l'environnement que les ménages. De plus, ces gaz sans chlore sont particulièrement performants dans un continent qui a grandement besoin de sécurité énergétique. Mais cet équilibre, vous souhaitez le détruire. Vous demandez aujourd'hui d'interdire totalement ces gaz sans chlore pour atteindre votre utopie permanente de la pollution zéro. Une logique qui ne profitera ni à l'environnement ni aux citoyens.

The industry there is doing really well and should be commended, and we should of course listen to the concerns about availability of alternatives to F-Gases. But there is an emergency brake in the regulation and, also, additional quota can be provided to heat pump manufacturers if shortages arise that might endanger the EU's heat pump installation targets.

Indeed, the compromises we discussed today together could bring about a total additional reduction in the EU's greenhouse gas emissions of roughly 500 million tonnes by 2050. This is a significant number, almost as high as the total annual greenhouse gas emissions of France and Belgium together. It is fundamental that we remain united in the fight against climate change, and that we do not close our eyes to the realities we see every time all over the world, including also in Europe – and also do not close our eyes to science. These rules will be the most ambitious in the world. This will allow others that start to reduce their consumption of F-gases to put in place ambitious policy. Important is the signal we put in place aimed at phasing out the use of these gases. With such legislation in place, we will be in an excellent position to advocate more ambitious measures on F-gases, on ODS under the Montreal Protocol.

Erst mal im Namen von Jessica Polfjärd ein Dankeschön für die große Unterstützung bei ihrem Bericht zu den ozonabbauenden Substanzen. Da gab es Gott sei Dank keine Kontroverse. Beim Thema F-Gase haben wir sehr gerungen und ich glaube, wir haben ein gutes Ergebnis erzielt. Es ist weniger ambitioniert, als der Umweltausschuss das wollte, aber es ist trotzdem ein großer Fortschritt für das Klima. Es gibt noch Kritik. Ich glaube, außerhalb der Kritik, die rein populistisch, rein antieuropäisch begründet ist, müssen wir uns ein Thema genau anschauen, Herr Kommissar, und das ist auch eine Bitte an die Mitgliedstaaten: Natürlich werden irgendwann auch keine neuen F-Gase mehr auf den Markt kommen, und da mag es das eine oder andere Kühlgerät geben, das noch in einer Bäckerei, einer Metzgerei, in einer Brauerei steht und das dann trotzdem noch repariert werden muss. Und da ist es aus meiner Sicht ganz besonders wichtig, dass wir das Recycling von F-Gasen jetzt massiv fördern – Kommission, Mitgliedstaaten – Ausbildung zur Verfügung stellen, Programme zur Verfügung stellen. Denn was passiert mit diesen F-Gasen, wenn sie nicht recycelt werden? Wenn alte Kühlgeräte entsorgt werden und man holt da das Gas nicht raus? Dann geht es in die Atmosphäre. Es ist also sowohl für die Wirtschaft als auch für das Klima ganz, ganz wichtig, dass wir das Recycling im großen Stil vorantreiben. Dann haben wir Revisionsklauseln. Ich hoffe, dass wir die nicht nutzen müssen. Wenn es nicht anders geht, müssen wir die nutzen. Aber am besten wäre es, wenn wir dann zu Beginn der Revision feststellen: Wir haben so viel recyceltes F-Gas, das läuft jetzt. Kommission und Mitgliedstaaten haben gute Arbeit geleistet, sodass wir dann wirklich keine neuen Gase mehr auf den Markt bringen müssen.",1927,Peter Liese,,rapporteur,"President, dear colleagues!First of all, in the name of Jessica Polfjärd, thank you for the great support in your report on the ozone -reducing substances.Thank God there was no controversy.We wrestled very much on the subject of F-gases and I think we achieved a good result.It is less ambitious than the environmental committee wanted, but it is still a great step forward for the climate.There is still criticism.I think outside of criticism, which is purely populist, purely anti-European, we have to take a closer look at a topic, Mr. Commissioner, and that is also a request to the Member States: Of course, at some point there will be no new F-gases on the marketcome, and there may be one or the other cooling unit that is still in a bakery, a butcher shop, in a brewery and then still needs to be repaired.And in my view, it is particularly important that we now massively promote the recycling of F-Gases-Commission, Member States-provide training, programs.Because what happens to these F-gases if they are not recycled?When old cooling devices are disposed of and you don't get the gas out of it?Then it goes into the atmosphere.So it is very, very important for both the economy and the climate that we drive recycling on a large scale.Then we have revision clauses.I hope we don't have to use them.If there is no other way, we have to use them.But it would be best if we find out at the beginning of the revision: We have so much recycled F-gas, it works now.Commission and Member States did a good job, so that we really no longer have to bring new gases onto the market."

It seems we have a solid majority for the vote tomorrow, and I'm really very thankful to the shadows and all the colleagues who contributed. So thanks very much for that. I just have to say that some colleagues expressed some criticism, but I had the feeling that this was more for their own YouTube channel than it was based on the facts of the legislation. Maybe I just want to explain that, and maybe they can add this element then to their YouTube channel – which they probably will not do, but nevertheless you always have to try. First of all, to Mr Nissinen from the ECR and Sweden. He was very much concerned about what is going to happen with all the people that have already bought heat pumps – uh, nothing, because this is about new equipment. So later on when you buy a heat pump, it will not contain those damaging gases. The ones you bought, you can use and you will use – you know that very well, but of course it didn't fit your story. Some of the ID colleagues were very much concerned that we are not looking at the market. Well I would say, Mr Lancini, that it is you who are not looking at the market. First of all, at this moment, the new monoblocs of heat pumps coming on the market already are without F-Gases. So the market is already there. The deadline we have is 2032, although they can deliver already now. So if we add them eight more years and they can deliver already and you are concerned they count, maybe you should catch up with the developments in the market. The same goes for split systems. The innovation is ongoing. They are delivering already now, they are available not so much yet, and that's why therefore the date is 2035. We even give them ten years. I think that is looking at the market. It is also looking at where the innovation is happening and that is European industry.

Tomorrow we will vote to endorse the interinstitutional agreement on the review of the Regulation and Directive on the Markets in Financial Infrastructure. The changes to both MiFIR and MiFID modify the rulebook governing participation in European capital markets, which play a fundamental role in channelling capital to the real economy. We need to ensure that our economy grows strong and remains competitive as there are long term challenges around. Europe requires more than EUR 500 billion of additional investment funding annually to ensure its sustainable competitiveness and resilience. This is not a mere financial challenge. It is a strategic imperative. Yet we remain dependent on bank-based financing while our capital markets are lagging behind. They are fragmented, which contributes to the inefficient allocation of capital. The once vibrant landscape of initial public offerings – IPOs – now stands at less than half the size of the US new listings. The US stock market's value relative to GDP is nearly twice that of the EU. Many in this House will remember that we embarked on building the Capital Markets Union back in 2015, but the project was tailored to the EU of 28 Member States with a major financial centre across the channel, and the focus was on national capital markets rather than on the removal of cross-border barriers. We need urgently to move away from fragmented capital markets and towards the idea of a capital market union. Advancing towards a truly single and vibrant capital market union is of fundamental importance for European open strategic autonomy. This context to the MiFIR and MiFID review, which had four key objectives: to reduce market fragmentation and market data costs; to harmonise and simplify the transparency rules; to enhance the levels of investor protection; and to increase the attractiveness and competitiveness of EU markets. I can proudly say that the text that we will vote on tomorrow achieves all these objectives. Thanks to the assertiveness of our House, for the first time, Europe will have a consolidated tape, a database designed to democratise access to market data and improve data quality by providing a continuous electronic live data stream on prices and trading volumes, consolidating the information obtained from multiple trading venues across the EU. It will reduce the fragmentation and cost of market data, will empower financial institutions and retail investors to observe in a single place the price and volumes for shares, ETFs, bonds or derivatives in the Union. The discussions on the consolidated tape were the most difficult part of the package, due to divergent views on the exact features that this new market infrastructure should have. In the review, we have also taken a careful look at the functioning of the market transparency rules in the Union, as well as in other jurisdictions. We put forward changes that seek to increase the competitiveness of EU firms, supported by the simplification and harmonisation of the transparency rules applicable across Europe. We have introduced greater flexibility in the framework by empowering the European Securities and Market Authority to set the thresholds and limits applicable to market transparency, and to oversee market developments, intervening when required. The harmonisation and simplification of transparency rules should strengthen the level playing field between all market participants and increase the overall transparency of European market structure. The report also mandates the Commission to carry out a holistic assessment of the financial markets legislation with respect to commodity derivatives, in light of the learnings from the energy crisis.

Wenn wir heute das Dossier Märkte für Finanzinstrumente diskutieren, kommen wir nicht um das drohende Verbot von payment for order flow herum. Diese Rückvergütung war das Fundament für Geschäftsmodelle zahlreicher deutscher und europäischer Start-ups. Erst dadurch hat das provisionsfreie Sparen am Kapitalmarkt Fahrt aufgenommen. Payment for order flow jetzt zu verbieten, halte ich für falsch und lehne ich ab. Es gefährdet das Aufstiegsversprechen einer ganzen Generation. Lassen Sie mich kurz auf drei Punkte eingehen: Wir leben in einer Zeit, in der es, dank innovativer Start-ups, nie einfacher war, in Sekundenschnelle einen kostenfreien ETF-Sparplan zur Altersvorsorge aufzusetzen. Payment for order flow haben zu einer wachsenden Aktienkultur beigetragen, und das ist gut so. Diese Aktienkultur ist ein zartes Pflänzchen. 8 von 10 Europäern legen nicht am Kapitalmarkt an, und wir stehen vor einer großen Rentenlücke. Wenn der deutsche Bundeskanzler bei hoher Inflation vor allem aufs Sparbuch setzt, ist das seine Sache, aber wir dürfen nicht durch Verbote in Europa dazu beitragen, dass der Kapitalmarkt unattraktiver wird. Für uns ist Aktienkultur Teil von Vermögensaufbau, Altersvorsorge und Aufstiegsversprechen. Das Verbot von payment for order flow soll einen Interessenkonflikt beim Aktienhandel verhindern, so heißt es. Doch wenn das Verbot kommt, dann sehe ich vor allem die Interessen von Kunden, Kleinanlegern und jungen Menschen betroffen. Wer im Monat 20, 30 oder 40 Euro einsetzt, kann sich keine großen Abgaben leisten. Hier geht es nicht um Zockerei, sondern darum, früh anzufangen und den eigenen Aufstieg zu ermöglichen.",197473,Christian Doleschal,PPE,au nom du groupe,"President, dear colleagues!If we discuss the dossier markets for financial instruments today, we cannot avoid the impending ban from Payment for Order Flow.This refund was the foundation for business models of numerous German and European start-ups.Only then has the commission -free savings on the capital market have started.I think Payment for Order Flow is now wrong and I reject.It endangers the promise of advancement of an entire generation.Let me go into three points briefly: We live at a time when, thanks to innovative start-ups, we have never been easier to set up a free ETF savings plan for old-age provision in a matter of seconds.Payment for Order Flow contributed to a growing stock culture, and that's a good thing.This share culture is a delicate plant.8 out of 10 Europeans do not create on the capital market and we are standing in front of a large pension gap.If the German Chancellor mainly relies on the savings book at high inflation, it is his thing, but we must not help bans in Europe to make the capital market more unattractive.For us, share culture is part of asset structure, retirement provision and promise of advancement.The ban on Payment for Order Flow is intended to prevent a conflict of interest in stock trading, it is said.But when the ban comes, I see the interests of customers, small investors and young people affected.Anyone who uses 20, 30 or 40 euros in the month cannot afford large taxes.This is not about gambling, but about starting early and enabling your own ascent."

Ich bin heute Abend richtig sauer, weil wir hier gerade einen Angriff auf die Aktienkultur in Europa unternehmen. Gerade seit der Pandemie haben insbesondere junge Menschen investiert, mit kleinen Beträgen: der Student oder der Azubi, der mal was zur Seite legt und investiert, ganz einfach über Neobroker am Aktienmarkt – und das sehr, sehr günstig. Statt da jetzt noch mehr zu tun, die Aktienkultur noch mehr zu stärken, legen wir jetzt einen Riegel vor mit dem Verbot von payment for order flow . Statt jetzt mit einem pauschalen Verbot ranzugehen, könnten wir doch mit Transparenz arbeiten, den Kundinnen und Kunden die Vor- und Nachteile zeigen – statt jetzt einfach alles zu verbieten, so wie das hier ist. Das wird nicht dazu führen, dass unsere Unternehmen, die Neobroker, innovativer sind. Es sorgt dafür, dass wir dort den Riegel vorschieben. Es wird auch dazu führen, dass die Aktienkultur in Europa zusammenbricht. Das ist genau das Europa, das wir nicht brauchen. Es ist ein zukunftsfeindliches, es ist ein bürokratisierendes Europa. Es ist kein Europa, das jungen Menschen und Aktiensparern eine Chance gibt.",197445,Moritz Körner,Renew,au nom du groupe,"Ms. President, dear colleagues!I'm really angry this evening because we are currently taking an attack on the share culture in Europe.Young people in particular have been investing in particular since pandemic, with small amounts: the student or trainee who puts and invests something aside, simply via neobroker on the stock market - and very, very cheap.Instead of doing even more to strengthen the share culture even more, we are now presenting a bar with the ban on Payment for Order Flow.Instead of going on with a blanket ban, we could work with transparency that customers show the advantages and disadvantages- instead of simply banning everything as it is.This will not lead to our companies that are more innovative.It ensures that we push the bar there.It will also lead to the share culture collapsing in Europe.This is exactly the Europe that we don't need.It is an anti -future, it is a bureaucratic Europe.It is not a Europe that gives young people and stock savings a chance."

En effet, comme l'ont souligné plusieurs études académiques au cours des deux dernières années, l'envolée des prix de l'énergie et des denrées alimentaires ayant entraîné l'inflation qu'on connaît n'est pas seulement la résultante de l'agression russe en Ukraine, mais également d'une spéculation excessive et de la manipulation de marchés par des investisseurs peu soucieux des impacts réels sur la vie quotidienne des citoyennes et des citoyens de l'Union européenne. Quelles ont été les conséquences concrètes de cette inflation? Des factures d'énergie aberrantes, des ménages ne pouvant faire face à certaines mensualités et devant se restreindre pour vivre convenablement ou, je dirais même, juste survivre. Grâce à l'action de notre groupe, grâce aux amendements que j'ai déposés et grâce à la volonté politique que nous avons eue lors des négociations, notamment face au Conseil et aux États membres, nous avons obtenu des victoires clés dans ces domaines. Ainsi, en cas de flambée des prix des matières premières et énergétiques sur les marchés financiers, désormais les autorités de marché auront la pleine capacité pour suspendre les transactions sur ceux-ci, ce qui permet d'éviter une inflation exponentielle soudaine sur des produits de première nécessité. De même, on peut se féliciter des revenus cette année et l'année prochaine par la Commission européenne des règles applicables aux activités financières accessoires des grands groupes non financiers et des limites de position. Nous connaissons les conséquences néfastes d'une spéculation excessive sur les marchés qui enrichit davantage les plus riches, mais qui appauvrit davantage les plus pauvres. Par ailleurs, notre groupe s'est battu depuis des années pour accroître la transparence sur les marchés financiers, condition sine qua non de leur bon fonctionnement, en créant un système consolidé de publications mettant les données de marché à disposition de tous les acteurs et accessible gratuitement par les particuliers, les ONG, les universitaires. Et je termine en disant que, oui, le texte n'est pas parfait, tant s'en faut, mais nous espérons initialement, Madame la rapporteure, que ce texte aura des avancées concrètes pour le porte-monnaie de nos concitoyens et nos concitoyens.",96868,Karima Delli,Verts/ALE,au nom du groupe,"Madam President, the Commissioner, my dear colleagues, the texts we debate today, as technical as they are, are very concrete examples of political battles and victories with a real impact on the seasons of citizens andcitizens of the European Union.Indeed, as pointed out by several academic studies in the past two years, the surge in energy prices and foodstuffs that caused inflation that we know is not only the result of theRussian aggression in Ukraine, but also excessive speculation and market manipulation by investors that are not concerned with real impacts on the daily life of citizens of the European Union.What were the concrete consequences of this inflation?Aberrant energy bills, households that cannot be faced with certain monthly payments and having to restrict themselves to live properly or, I would even say, just survive.Thanks to the action of our group, thanks to the amendments I have deposited and thanks to the political will that we had during the negotiations, in particular against the Council and the Member States, we obtained key victories in these areas.Thus, in the event of the prices of raw and energy material prices on the financial markets, now market authorities will have the full capacity to suspend transactions on them, which makes it possible to avoid sudden exponential inflation on products from productsfirst necessity.Likewise, revenues can be congratulated this year and next year by the European Commission, rules applicable to the accessory financial activities of large non -financial groups and position limits.We know the harmful consequences of excessive speculation on the markets which enriches the richest, but which further impoverishes the poorest.In addition, our group has fought for years to increase transparency on the financial markets, a sine qua non condition for their proper functioning, by creating a consolidated publication system making the market data available to all players and accessibleFree by individuals, NGOs, academics.And I end by saying that, yes, the text is not perfect, as it is so necessary, but we initially hope, Madam Rapporteur, that this text will have concrete advances for the wallet of our fellow citizens and our fellow citizens and our fellow citizens and our fellow citizens and our fellow citizens."

Zvýšenie transparentnosti je dôležité kvôli zvýšeniu dôveryhodnosti obchodovania na kapitálových trhoch pre všetky kategórie investorov. To povedie k intenzívnejšej hospodárskej súťaži, a teda aj k jednoduchšiemu získavaniu finančných prostriedkov z kapitálových trhov. Veľkým problémom, ktorý na kapitálových trhoch v Európskej únii ale naďalej pretrváva, sú aj vyššie náklady investovania pre retailových investorov oproti iným krajinám. Jednou z príčin týchto rozdielov sú aj samotné regulačné náklady. Podľa viacerých štúdií spôsobila právna úprava MiFID II zúženie ponuky investičných produktov a služieb, zníženie ziskovosti investičných spoločností kvôli vysokým nákladom regulácie a v konečnom dôsledku viac bariér pre vstup, ako aj zlúčenia a akvizície pre malé investičné spoločnosti v tomto regióne. Príliš veľa povinností a byrokratických postupov môže byť prekážkou pre spotrebiteľov aj podniky zároveň. Naším cieľom by malo byť zvyšovanie celkového blahobytu, a nie zvyšovanie počtu práv spotrebiteľov za každú cenu bez ohľadu na to, či sa nakoniec ukážu ako užitočné. Bolo by preto vhodné, aby Komisia zanalyzovala aj regulačné náklady regulácie a jej dopady na ceny.",197767,Eugen Jurzyca,ECR,au nom du groupe,"I welcome to an increase in transparency and availability of price data on the capital markets to which this proposal brings.Increasing transparency is important to increase the credibility of trading in capital markets for all investor categories.This will lead to a more intensive competition and thus to the easier raising of funds from capital markets.However, higher costs of investment for retail investors compared to other countries are also a major problem that continues to persist in the European Union.One of the causes of these differences is the regulatory costs themselves.According to several studies, the Mifid II legislation has caused a narrowing of the offer of investment products and services, a reduction in profitability of investment companies due to the high cost of regulation and ultimately more barriers for entry, as well as mergers and acquisitions for small investment companies in the region.Too many duties and bureaucratic procedures can be an obstacle to both consumers and businesses at the same time.Our goal should be to increase the overall well -being, not to increase the number of consumers' rights at any cost, regardless of whether they will eventually prove to be useful.It would therefore be appropriate for the Commission to analyze the regulatory costs of regulation and its impact on prices."

É o que acontece no caso dos derivados da energia – um setor que já tinha impactos nos preços da energia e na carteira das pessoas, mas que teve impactos agravados no contexto da guerra na Ucrânia. Apesar de terem sido aprovadas algumas propostas positivas a este nível, elas são propostas de emergência, que não resolvem o problema estrutural no mercado dos derivados da energia, que teve impactos muito negativos no aumento dos preços da energia e, portanto, no orçamento das famílias. E é pena que a regulação do sistema financeiro e, particularmente, dos derivados fique sempre aquém daquilo que é necessário, criando um jogo de gato e rato entre regulador e regulados, em que quem tem como objetivo defender o interesse público está sempre a correr muito atrás. É também verdade que foram resolvidos conflitos de interesse nos pagamentos aos corretores e isso é positivo, embora o que existia antes – convenhamos – fosse bastante grotesco. E é também verdade que foram introduzidas normas de transparência nestes mercados. Mas tudo isto é muito pouco, sobretudo em face dos custos que os cidadãos tiveram que suportar por causa da desregulação destes mercados.",88715,José Gusmão,The Left,au nom du groupe,"President, this report is a good example of the habit, which has been developed, to sub -regulate the financial system, doing enough to do something and not doing enough to be effective.This is what happens in the case of energy derivatives - a sector that already had impacts on people's energy prices and wallet, but has aggravated impacts on the context of the war in Ukraine.Although some positive proposals have been approved at this level, they are emergency proposals, which do not solve the structural problem in the energy derived market, which had very negative impacts on increasing energy prices and, therefore, on the budget of families.And it is pity that the regulation of the financial system and, particularly, the derivatives always fall short of what is necessary, creating a cat and rat game between regulator and regulated, where those who aim to defend the public interest is always running a lotback.It is also true that conflicts of interest in payments to brokers have been resolved and this is positive, although what existed before - let's face it - was quite grotesque.And it is also true that transparency rules have been introduced in these markets.But all this is very little, especially in the face of the costs that citizens had to bear because of the deregulation of these markets."

Üdítő végre egy olyan témában felszólalni, melyben a józan ész talaján állunk. A pénzügyi eszközök piacairól szóló jogszabályok felülvizsgálatával erősödik a befektetők helyzete, és a vállalkozások is könnyebben juthatnak majd forráshoz a tőkepiacról. A cégek finanszírozása nagyrészt banki hitelezésen keresztül történik Európában, a tőkepiacok gyengébbek, mint Amerikában, és ez versenyhátrányt jelent. A digitális és zöld átállás beruházásai ugyanakkor hatalmas összegeket igényelnek, amihez elengedhetetlen a magántőke bevonása. A mostani javaslat ezt segíti. A tárgyalások során kulcsfontosságú volt, hogy a tőzsdei információkhoz való könnyebb hozzáférés ne veszélyeztesse a kisebb tőzsdék működését. A Bizottság indító javaslata érthetetlen módon a nagy, akár Európán kívüli tulajdonban levő szolgáltatóknak kedvezett, s a kis, független európai tőzsdék létét veszélyeztette. Szerencsére a Tanács és a Parlament ezt kiigazította. Köszönjük a rapportőrnek is. Így mindenki számára előnyös megoldás született. Emellett az átláthatóság is javul annak a tilalomnak köszönhetően, miszerint a brókerek nem kaphatnak pénzt azért, hogy az ügyfelektől kapott megbízásokat bizonyos kereskedési platformokra irányítják. Fontos lépést teszünk tehát az átláthatóbb és hozzáférhetőbb tőkepiacok felé, de bőven maradt tennivalónk a tőkepiaci unió mélyítése érdekében.",96830,Enikő Győri,NI,,"Dear President!It is refreshing to speak on a topic where we are on the ground of common sense.By reviewing the legislation on financial assets markets, investors will be strengthened and businesses will be able to get fundamental funding from the capital market.Companies are funded largely through bank lending in Europe, capital markets are weaker than America, which means a competitive disadvantage.At the same time, the digital and green transition investments require huge amounts, which is essential to involving private capital.This is helped by this proposal.During the negotiations, it was crucial that easier access to stock exchange information should not be jeopardized by smaller stock exchanges.The Commission's launch proposal was incomprehensible to large service providers, even outside Europe, and threatened the existence of small, independent European stock exchanges.Fortunately, the Council and the Parliament adjusted this.Thank you to the rapporter.This resulted in a beneficial solution for everyone.In addition, transparency is improved due to the ban that brokers cannot receive money to direct customers to certain trading platforms.So we take an important step towards more transparent and accessible capital markets, but we have plenty to do to deepen the capital market union."

Simplemente por respetar su legado, tenemos que reconocer que continúa habiendo mercados concretos en la Unión que siguen sin estar suficientemente consolidados: uno de ellos es el mercado de capitales. Quiero felicitar a Danuta Hübner por su trabajo, que ha llevado a que hoy aprobemos dos Reglamentos para impulsar esa unión de los mercados de capitales, tanto desde el punto de vista minorista —para que los ahorradores tengan más y mejor información y, además, se prohíban algunas actividades, que generaban costes y apenas aportaban ningún valor— como una propuesta legislativa que aborda cómo debemos mejorar ese mercado de capitales desde la perspectiva mayorista. Pero, aun celebrando estos acuerdos, tenemos que reconocer el trabajo que todavía nos queda por delante.

Comme l'a dit ma collègue Karima, rapporteure fictive dans ce délicat dossier, les textes qui en sont sortis auront en effet un impact très concret sur le porte-monnaie de nos concitoyens et concitoyennes, et nous pouvons nous féliciter des victoires portées par la famille des écologistes, ici. Dans mon travail au sein de la commission ECON de notre institution, depuis plusieurs mois, j'ai lu et entendu des propos d'experts et d'expertes pointant le rôle de la spéculation sans limite et des manipulations de marché dans des hausses extrêmes de prix que nous avons connus depuis le 24 février 2022 et le déclenchement de cette guerre par Poutine en Ukraine. Combien de millions de personnes parmi les plus vulnérables ont été dans l'obligation de demander un échelonnement des factures et ont été dans l'obligation de ne pas se chauffer ou de procéder à des coupes dans leur budget quotidien, pour pouvoir régler leurs factures de chauffage, d'électricité comme l'hiver dernier et l'hiver en cours. Selon le rapport annuel d'Oxfam sur les inégalités qui vient de paraître aujourd'hui, 99 % de la population européenne s'est appauvrie ces trois dernières années. Oui, 99 % de la population européenne s'est appauvrie ces trois dernières années. Non, la spéculation financière n'est pas l'unique cause de cette inflation, mais oui, elle a joué un rôle que personne ne peut sérieusement nier. Et pourtant, ce facteur a été complètement négligé par la Commission européenne et a été tout bonnement ignoré par les groupes de droite de cet hémicycle, trop occupés à défendre les intérêts des grandes entreprises. La disposition que mon groupe a portée dans le coupe-circuit, cette capacité donnée aux autorités de marché de suspendre les opérations sur des produits donnés en cas de volatilité conséquente, permet d'atténuer, à défaut d'annihiler complètement, ce problème de façon significative. Le sujet est cependant loin d'être clos et beaucoup reste à faire. Lors de notre prochain mandat, nous serons là pour nous assurer que les grandes entreprises non financières qui agissent comme des spéculateurs sans scrupules soient bel et bien soumises aux mêmes règles que les traders. Dès 2025, nous nous battrons pour ériger de véritables barrières contre la spéculation sur les matières premières.

But it was not the case in this review where, thanks to the strong support of all political groups in Parliament and of the Commission, we were able to secure an agreement that is a great success for the Parliament. This House has shown once more that we continue to show the ambition to push towards the creation of a truly single capital market union for the benefit of all European citizens. Given the positive outcome and the strong endorsement at the ECON Committee level, there were only two abstentions. There was no negative vote and nobody was against. I would like to invite all the colleagues to vote in favour of the Interinstitutional Agreement tomorrow."

Until today, 28 attacks were carried out by the Houthis since mid-November. The Houthis are presenting their repeated attacks as a support to the Palestinian people, and they have launched some missiles toward Israel. The Houthis, together with Hezbollah and some Iraqi and Syrian militias, are aligned with Hamas. The EU has continuously condemned those acts and underlined that they must stop, notably through the EU spokesperson’s statements of 5 and 13 December, and through our latest EU 27 statement of 12 January. The EU also called for the immediate release of the Galaxy Leader vessel and its 25-member crew, illegally seized on 19 November. EU services are also following closely the joint military response of the UK and US, members of the Prosperity Guardian Operation, to repeated Houthi attacks against maritime vessels. The US and UK have carried out joint strikes on 11 and 12 January on over 60 targets at 16 sites in Yemen, with the support of Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands, as a response to repeated and escalating Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, notably the complex attack of 9 January, following repeated messages from the international community. The EU continues actively engaging and coordinating with partners in all diplomatic fora to counter the Houthi threats to commercial vessels and find effective solutions. The High Representative, on behalf of the EU and its Member States issued a joint statement, published last Friday, welcoming the 10 January UN Security Council Resolution 2722. The UN Security Resolution recognises that states are entitled to defend themselves against the attack against their vessels in perfect contradiction, by the way, of international law.

Further options will be discussed at the level of the European Council concerning the EU maritime response. However, it is unlikely that the Houthis will be deterred immediately, given the international visibility they have enjoyed with these actions. Houthi leaders have already indicated they will continue their attacks as long as the situation in Gaza remains. They have already resumed attacks, with a missile fired towards US forces on 14 January.

На първо място, перспективата на международната сигурност и сигурността на международната търговия, като знаем, че огромна част от световния търговски трафик преминава през Червено море. И тук трябва да заявим съвсем ясно каква е ситуацията. Така наречената „групировка на хутите“ е терористична група, която се занимава с пиратска дейност в морските територии на най-интензивен световен търговски трафик, най-интензивно световно мореплаване. От тази гледна точка, макар и ограниченият, но военен отговор на тези пиратски действия не подлежи на съмнение като вярна и адекватна мярка. Това е винаги адекватната мярка срещу пиратски действия, застрашаващи световната сигурност и световното търговско мореплаване. Аз съм шокиран да чуя, между другото, и то неведнъж от хора, които политически оценявам като руски активи, това, че нанасянето на удари срещу военните способности на тази пиратска групировка е проблем за търговския трафик, а не за нейната пиратска дейност. Няма съмнение обаче, че трябва да гледаме на тази криза и от нейната хуманитарна гледна точка, от гледна точка на живота и правата на цивилното население в Йемен. И тук отново трябва да отбележим, че тъй наречените „хути“ са групировка, пряко спонсорирана, изцяло обезпечена от ислямисткия терористичен режим в Иран, която носи огромна отговорност за продължаващата вече над 10 години гражданска война и за стотиците хиляди жертви – цивилни, мирни йеменски граждани, и за покъртителния глад, последица от тази гражданска война в Йемен.",197839,Radan Kanev,PPE,au nom du groupe,"Mrs. President, this debate can be led by at least two, even three perspectives.First, the perspective of international security and security of international trade, knowing that a huge part of world trade traffic is crossing the Red Sea.And here we have to say quite clearly what the situation is.The so-called ""Hutt Group"" is a terrorist group that is engaged in pirate activity in the maritime territories of the most intense world commercial traffic, the most intense worldwide navigation.From this point of view, although the limited but military response to these pirate actions, it is not doubtful as a true and adequate measure.This is always an adequate measure against pirate action that threatens world security and world trade navigation.I am shocked to hear, by the way, and more than once by people who have politically appreciated as Russian assets, that the struck against the military capabilities of this pirate group is a problem for commercial traffic, not its pirate activity.However, there is no doubt that we must also look at this crisis from its humanitarian point of view, in terms of life and the rights of the civilian population in Yemen.Here again, it should be noted that the so -called Huti is a group, directly sponsored, fully secured by the Islamist terrorist regime in Iran, which has a huge responsibility for the civil war on over 10 years and for hundreds of thousands of civilian, peaceful, peaceCitizens, and for the abusive hunger, a consequence of this civil war in Yemen."

We totally condemn the ongoing attacks on maritime activities in the Red Sea from these Houthi-controlled territories in Yemen with the support of Iran. The Houthi attacks threaten the international navigation and the maritime security in grave disrespect from international law, and they endanger the lives of the civilian crews, some of them already abducted, and create serious environmental and obvious economic risks. Contrary to what the Houthi leaders say, the attacks are of no help in addressing the war in Gaza. In fact, they further destabilise the region and create increased risks for the populations. They also destabilise the world commerce, with effects that are already being felt in many regions in the world. We don’t need another factor to fuel a possible economic crisis. We therefore urge the Houthis to immediately stop the attacks, and call on all parties to avoid further escalation in the region. We particularly want to tell directly to the Iran regime: be on the right side for once, on the side of stability in your own region. We call on the Member States to be meaningful and take immediate and concerted efforts to address these attacks if the Houthis, of course, do not stop immediately. We need an effective operation in the Red Sea, with an executive mandate to ensure the naval security in the region. This should be built from close cooperation with the regional actors, but also with our international parties, many of them which are already acting on the ground. There is no more time for ambiguities. Europe is a commercial stronghold in the world, but that also means we must protect our trade capacities. Europe and the world are already suffering from the consequences of successive wars, and the spike on energy prices and inflation that came with it. People are dying by the thousands because of these wars. We cannot add the death or the abduction of the crews in the Red Sea, the destruction of our vessels, and the health of a good part of the world commerce to all the tragedies already taking place in front of us. The EU is a world player and should act as such, including, as the High Representative referred recently, by enforcing the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2722, which reiterates that the states have the right to defend their vessels against these attacks in accordance to international law.

The European Labour Authority is still a young agency, with high expectations attached to it. Living up to these expectations takes time and might require adjustments. ELA has already come a long way and its actions are making a real difference to ensure EU labour mobility. ELA is here to support, directly and indirectly, the millions of Europeans who live or work in another Member State, as well as businesses operating across EU borders. It offers practical support in cross-border employment via its network, helping jobseekers and employers find each other. It analyses labour mobility, providing us with intelligence, so we understand the latest trends and get the data we need. It tackles undeclared work, which deprives workers of social protection, distorts competition between businesses and leads to huge gaps in public finances. One of the European Labour Authority's main tasks is to improve access to information for mobile workers and their employers. It is not enough to have rules and regulations for social protection; workers need to understand them and employers need to assume responsibility for them. Europe should be the beacon, the gold standard when it comes to labour market conditions, regardless of where the worker comes from. ELA plays a central role in this endeavour. Since it was created five years ago, ELA has supported more than 100 cross-border, joint and concerted inspections and has provided substantial support for the Member States, working to develop cooperation programmes, including on posting of workers. The Commission is currently in the process of evaluating the first five years of ELA's operation. Your resolution is extremely important in this context, together with the contribution from the Belgian Presidency via a conference organised at the end of January, which will contribute to the evaluation. When considering a possible revision of the mandate of ELA, we should take two points into account. First, we have to analyse carefully which parts of ELA's functioning could be improved eventually without such a revision. Second, it is important to see the final results of the evaluation and to draw the adequate conclusions. The mission of ELA is to improve enforcement of the fair mobility EU legislation. This needs to remain at the core while we address remaining challenges. For example, one of these challenges relates to the entry, employment and working conditions of third-country nationals. We recently had particularly worrisome situations with third-country nationals in the transport sector. ELA has been active and here is a need to evaluate if its means are sufficient and appropriate. The set-up of ELA allows a close involvement of social partners, but there is still scope for additional engagement. The suggestion that ELA should be able to bring detected breaches in front of a court of the concerned Member States will require a sound legal analysis. With regard to social security coordination and its digitalisation, a pilot project of the European Social Security Pass is ongoing. The support of ELA in this field will remain crucial, for instance, by facilitating the regular exchange of experiences between national authorities. There should be synergies between the work of different agencies for achieving efficiency gains and avoiding overlaps. This is particularly important when it comes to tackling skills mismatches, since other agencies, such as Cedefop, are also working on this matter. I am confident the European Parliament will continue to be our close partner to tackle these important challenges in the field of fair mobility.

Mit der hier vorgelegten Stellungnahme machen wir als Europäisches Parlament unsere Erwartungshaltung in Richtung Europäische Kommission, was das neue ELA-Mandat angeht, deutlich. Und man muss sagen – der Herr Kommissar hat ja auch darauf hingewiesen – der Start von ELA war gut, bei allen Geburtsschwierigkeiten, die eine neue Behörde immer mit sich bringt. Aber jetzt geht es darum, dem Tiger auch Zähne zu geben. Und ich glaube, das Beispiel der Lkw-Fahrer in Gräfenhausen, die zweimal im letzten Jahr gestreikt haben, macht deutlich, warum das mehr als überfällig ist. Denn die Frage von nicht gezahlten Löhnen und auch die Frage, wie gehen wir mit Beschäftigten aus Drittstaaten um, die müssen in das Portfolio der ELA mit aufgenommen werden. Das hat Gräfenhausen mehr als deutlich gezeigt. Und es geht bei dem neuen Mandat aus meiner Sicht um zwei Dinge, die ganz wesentlich sind: Zum einen natürlich, dass wir als Europäische Union einen aktiven Beitrag dazu leisten, Beschäftigte vor Ausbeutung zu schützen und Beschäftigten den Rücken zu stärken, wenn es um die Durchsetzung ihrer Rechte geht. Das ist das eine. Aber das andere ist – und das ist fast genauso wichtig: Wenn wir vom Binnenmarkt als Herzstück der Europäischen Union sprechen, dann müssen wir auch sicherstellen, dass die Regeln, die für den Binnenmarkt gelten, auch eingehalten werden. Denn wir können hier Gesetzgebung ohne Ende – wie, um bei dem Beispiel zu bleiben, das Mobilitätspaket – auf den Weg bringen. Aber wenn keine Durchsetzung stattfindet, wenn – wie im Fall von Gräfenhausen – Behörden sich gegenseitig die Verantwortung zuschieben und die ELA nicht mal ein Recht hat, initiativ tätig zu werden, dann zeigt das die Probleme. Die haben wir in unserem Bericht, in unserer Stellungnahme adressiert, in der Hoffnung, dass die Kommission den Ball auch aufnimmt.",188945,Dennis Radtke,PPE,au nom du groupe,"Mrs. Vice President, Mr. Commissioner, dear Agnes, dear colleagues!With the statement presented here, we, as a European Parliament, make our expectations towards the European Commission, as far as the new ELA mandate is concerned.And you have to say - the Commissioner also pointed out this - the start of Ela was good, with all birth difficulties that a new authority always brings with it.But now it's about giving the tiger teeth.And I think the example of the truck driver in Gräfenhausen, who went on strike twice in the last year, makes it clear why this is more than overdue.Because the question of unpaid wages and also the question of how do we deal with employees from third countries, which must be included in the ELA portfolio.Gräfenhausen has shown more than clearly.And in my view, the new mandate is about two things that are very important: on the one hand, of course, that as a European Union, we, as a European Union, make an active contribution to protecting employees from exploitation and strengthening their backsImplementation of your rights.That is one thing.But the other is - and that is almost as important: if we speak of the internal market as a heart of the European Union, then we also have to make sure that the rules that apply to the internal market are also met.Because we can get legislation without end - how to stay with the example, the mobility package.But if there is no enforcement if - as in the case of Gräfenhausen - authorities, the authorities are responsible and the ELA does not even have a right to work initiative, then this shows the problems.In our report, we addressed them in our opinion, in the hope that the Commission will also accept the ball."

Autoritatea Europeană a Muncii (ELA) a fost înființată tocmai pentru acest obiectiv. Într-un timp extrem de scurt, cu un management excelent, a devenit funcțională, preluându-și atribuțiile. Cu toate acestea, este evident că aceasta nu și-a atins încă întregul potențial. Întrebarea este de ce? Caracterul voluntar al cooperării între statele membre, competențele limitate și cadrul juridic rigid i-au pus piedici. ELA ar trebui să aibă puterea să inițieze și să desfășoare investigații de una singură, mai ales atunci când autoritățile naționale nu fac nimic sau chiar ajung să protejeze politic guvernele. ELA este autoritatea la care trebuie să apelăm atunci când angajatorul nu își respectă regulile contractuale și ne trezim cu salarii neplătite, iar instituțiile statului nu fac nimic să ajute. ELA este autoritatea la care apelăm când suntem victima unui abuz la locul de muncă și nu ni se face dreptate. Asta așteaptă cetățenii europeni: așteaptă să vadă cum regulile la nivel european sunt îndeplinite. Trebuie să recunoaștem impactul pe care ELA îl poate avea și să-i oferim resursele și accesul necesar, să asigurăm un spațiu de colaborare, astfel încât ELA să urmărească cu vigilență cazurile aduse în atenție și să acționeze unde e necesar.

Comme l'a dit ma collègue Karima, rapporteure fictive dans ce délicat dossier, les textes qui en sont sortis auront en effet un impact très concret sur le porte-monnaie de nos concitoyens et concitoyennes, et nous pouvons nous féliciter des victoires portées par la famille des écologistes, ici. Dans mon travail au sein de la commission ECON de notre institution, depuis plusieurs mois, j'ai lu et entendu des propos d'experts et d'expertes pointant le rôle de la spéculation sans limite et des manipulations de marché dans des hausses extrêmes de prix que nous avons connus depuis le 24 février 2022 et le déclenchement de cette guerre par Poutine en Ukraine. Combien de millions de personnes parmi les plus vulnérables ont été dans l'obligation de demander un échelonnement des factures et ont été dans l'obligation de ne pas se chauffer ou de procéder à des coupes dans leur budget quotidien, pour pouvoir régler leurs factures de chauffage, d'électricité comme l'hiver dernier et l'hiver en cours. Selon le rapport annuel d'Oxfam sur les inégalités qui vient de paraître aujourd'hui, 99 % de la population européenne s'est appauvrie ces trois dernières années. Oui, 99 % de la population européenne s'est appauvrie ces trois dernières années. Non, la spéculation financière n'est pas l'unique cause de cette inflation, mais oui, elle a joué un rôle que personne ne peut sérieusement nier. Et pourtant, ce facteur a été complètement négligé par la Commission européenne et a été tout bonnement ignoré par les groupes de droite de cet hémicycle, trop occupés à défendre les intérêts des grandes entreprises. La disposition que mon groupe a portée dans le coupe-circuit, cette capacité donnée aux autorités de marché de suspendre les opérations sur des produits donnés en cas de volatilité conséquente, permet d'atténuer, à défaut d'annihiler complètement, ce problème de façon significative. Le sujet est cependant loin d'être clos et beaucoup reste à faire. Lors de notre prochain mandat, nous serons là pour nous assurer que les grandes entreprises non financières qui agissent comme des spéculateurs sans scrupules soient bel et bien soumises aux mêmes règles que les traders. Dès 2025, nous nous battrons pour ériger de véritables barrières contre la spéculation sur les matières premières.

Een jaar of vijf geleden stond ik hier als een trotse rapporteur voor de oprichting van de Europese Arbeidsautoriteit (ELA). Een historische stap voor de Europese Unie om ervoor te zorgen dat onze gemeenschappelijke, interne markt niet alleen vrij, maar ook eerlijk is. Om ervoor te zorgen dat vrij verkeer van personen niet alleen vrij, maar ook eerlijk is. In de Europese Unie mag er geen ruimte zijn voor schijnzelfstandigheid, sociale dumping of oneerlijke concurrentie op de arbeidsmarkt. Er mag geen ruimte zijn voor uitbuiting van mensen via schandalige werk- of woonomstandigheden, geen race to the bottom als het gaat om arbeidsvoorwaarden. Geen ruimte, kortom, voor onmenselijke situaties. Toch zien we daar helaas nog steeds te veel van. Vijf jaar geleden hebben wij als Europees Parlement met vereende krachten van links tot rechts geprobeerd om de bevoegdheden van de Europese Arbeidsautoriteit zo sterk mogelijk te maken, tegen de protesten van enkele lidstaten in. Nu ELA zich in de afgelopen jaren zo goed ontwikkeld heeft en ook in de praktijk laat zien wat voor een potentie daarvan uitgaat, is het absoluut tijd om naar de toekomst te kijken en de bevoegdheden van ELA zo snel mogelijk fors uit te breiden. Het belangrijkste is, en dat wil ik hier heel graag benadrukken, dat ELA meer bevoegdheden krijgt om haar taken uit te voeren, ook ten aanzien van werknemers van buiten Europa. We zien meer en meer schijnzelfstandigen uit derde landen die actief zijn op de Europese arbeidsmarkt en dat leidt tot grote problemen. Het is een grensoverschrijdende uitdaging die ook grensoverschrijdend via ELA bij de horens gevat moet worden. Een sterkere autoriteit is absoluut nodig om deze en andere misstanden op de Europese arbeidsmarkt echt aan te pakken. Iedereen die gelooft in het belang van een echte eerlijke Europese arbeidsmarkt, moet zich daar in het nieuwe mandaat van dit Parlement keihard voor inzetten.",95074,Jeroen Lenaers,PPE,,"Chairman, Dear Commissioner, Dear Colleagues.About five years ago I was here as a proud rapporteur for the establishment of the European Labor Authority (ELA).A historic step for the European Union to ensure that our common, internal market is not only free, but also fair.To ensure that free movement of people is not only free, but also fair.In the European Union there must be no room for false independence, social dumping or unfair competition on the labor market.There should be no room for exploitation of people through outrageous work or living conditions, not a race to the bottom when it comes to employment conditions.No space, in short, for inhuman situations.Yet we still see that too much of that.Five years ago, as European Parliament with united forces from left to right, we tried to make the powers of the European Labor Authority as strong as possible, against the protests of a few Member States.Now that Ela has developed so well in recent years and also shows in practice what the potential is going, it is absolutely time to look at the future and to extend Ela's powers as quickly as possible.The most important thing is, and I would really like to emphasize that here, that Ela will have more powers to perform its duties, also with regard to employees from outside Europe.We see more and more false self -employed from third countries who are active in the European labor market and that leads to major problems.It is a cross -border challenge that must also be caught by Ela Via the horns.A stronger authority is absolutely necessary to really tackle these and other abuses on the European labor market.Everyone who believes in the interest of a real honest European labor market must be very hard for this in the new mandate of this parliament."

Översynen måste därför ta hänsyn till att de nationella systemen för inspektioner ser olika ut och att de i vissa medlemsländer också ansvarar för inspektioner, vilket parlamentets resolution framhåller.

2024-01-15,20:25:57.989,20:27:43.000,106,Revision of the European Labour Authority mandate (debate),"Voorzitter, commissaris, collega’s, arbeidsmobiliteit is alomtegenwoordig: 10 miljoen EU-burgers werken in een andere lidstaat en evenveel niet EU-burgers werken in de EU. Dit biedt kansen, maar het mag geen vrijgeleide zijn voor misbruik en sociale dumping. Daarom werd de Europese Arbeidsautoriteit (ELA) opgericht voor het faciliteren van goed functionerende arbeidsmarkten, voor de ondersteuning van socialezekerheidsstelsels en voor het waarborgen van eerlijke concurrentie op de interne markt. Zo faciliteerde ELA in 2022 37 inspecties die betrekking hadden op 2700 werknemers in verschillende sectoren, zoals vervoer, bouw, distributie, landbouw en vleesindustrie. Er werden in totaal 1762 inbreuken vastgesteld, maar de activiteiten van ELA worden beperkt door het vrijwillige karakter van de samenwerking en de deelname van de lidstaten. Daarom pleiten we voor een grondige herziening en uitbreiding van het ELA-mandaat, zodat de Autoriteit zelf vermeende inbreuken kan onderzoeken en inspecties organiseren. Daarom pleiten we ook voor meer nationale arbeids- en socialezekerheidsinspecties en een verhoging van de middelen voor ELA zelf. We pleiten voor meer betrokkenheid van de sociale partners en voor meer samenwerking tussen de lidstaten en, zoals al door veel collega’s aangehaald, om de toepassing uit te breiden naar niet EU-onderdanen.

Die ELA, das haben viele unterstrichen, war wirklich wichtig, um das Vertrauen zu schaffen, dass wir wirklich eine faire Mobilität wollen und sie auch hinkriegen und dass wir dafür auch grenzüberschreitende Institutionen haben. Ich möchte den beiden Berichterstattern wirklich danken für diesen Vorschlag, für dieses Dokument. Zwei Punkte möchte ich unterstreichen und dabei auch auf Herrn Kósa eingehen: Wenn wir gerade jetzt mehr Drittstaatsangehörige nach Europa holen wollen, weil wir ein Fachkräfteproblem haben, und gleichzeitig aber nichts tun, dass wir in bestimmten Sektoren Wildwestmethoden haben, Ausbeutung – Gräfenhausen ist hier genannt worden –, dann geht das nicht zusammen. Außerdem haben wir inzwischen tatsächlich digitale Instrumente, um sicherzustellen, dass wir wirklich viel stärker identifizieren können: Wo sind die kritischen Sektoren? Wo sind auch Unternehmen, die systematisch zum Beispiel ausbeuten, wie es bei Mazur in Polen ja der Fall war? Dazu können wir künstliche Intelligenz nutzen.

Die Europäische Arbeitsbehörde ist wichtig, wenn sie das Richtige tut. Wir erleben, dass viel zu tun ist auf dem Kontinent Europa, in unseren Mitgliedstaaten, und dass es viele Hände braucht, um die Arbeit zu erledigen, besonders in Zeiten wirtschaftlicher Krisen, sogar einer Rezession in manchen Teilen Europas. Gleichzeitig erleben wir Arbeitskräftemangel. Es gibt nicht eine singuläre Lösung, sondern es braucht viele Lösungen, um dem Arbeitskräftemangel zu begegnen. Dazu gehört ganz sicher, die Arbeitsbedingungen für Arbeitnehmerinnen und Arbeitnehmer zu verbessern, in jeder Hinsicht – in finanzieller Hinsicht, aber auch in struktureller Hinsicht, auch in Sachen Kinderbetreuung, auch in Sachen Pflege, im Umfeld insgesamt. Dazu gehört selbstverständlich auch ein Zurückschrauben der irregulären Migration und die Chance für eine legale Arbeitsmigration für Menschen, die sich in unsere Gesellschaften integrieren wollen und können und die anpacken können auf unseren Arbeitsmärkten. Die internationale Situation zeigt, dass der Wettbewerb mit anderen Teilen der Welt, wo zweifellos hart gearbeitet wird, immer größer wird, immer stärker wird.

2024-01-15,20:34:28.431,20:38:59.000,271,Revision of the European Labour Authority mandate (debate),"Madame la Présidente, je crois que la journée est bien choisie pour avoir un débat sur l'Autorité européenne du travail. Nous avons, au début de cette session, rendu hommage à Jacques Delors, à sa mémoire, mais surtout à son action. Pour lui, le marché intérieur, qui a été beaucoup cité, et la libre circulation n'étaient pas une fin en soi. Il est clair que pour lui il ne pouvait y avoir marché intérieur et libre circulation sans une forte dimension sociale, sans un niveau élevé de protection sociale de tous les travailleurs. C'était son souhait. J'avoue que les progrès, et il l'a considéré également de cette manière, que les progrès ont été parfois trop lents. Mais on a réussi à faire des progrès, je rappelle simplement, par exemple, la directive sur le détachement. Mais nous savons tous que les directives sont utiles, importantes, parfois décisives, mais ce qui compte vraiment c'est leur mise en œuvre. Et ce n'est pas la mise en œuvre après des mois et des années de cas devant les juridictions – et je ne diminue pas l'importance des juridictions. Mais quand les travailleurs sont confrontés, comme cela a été le cas précis – mais il y a d'autres, beaucoup d'autres cas – à des situations de dumping social, d'exploitation, de refus de voir leurs salaires payés, de conditions de travail inacceptables, etc., ce qu'ils demandent, c'est une mise en œuvre immédiate, c'est une réaction immédiate, c'est pouvoir compter sur une instance qui les protège. C'est l'objectif de l'AET. Je dois dire – c'était la Commission précédente présidée par mon compatriote – que l'AET a apporté des changements. Aujourd'hui, on peut discuter: si la protection sociale doit s'appliquer à des ressortissants de pays tiers qui viennent en Europe pour travailler, si on peut remettre en cause leur protection, les mêmes droits auxquels ils ont droit, ce n'est pas dans l'esprit européen, ce n'est pas l'esprit de Delors, ce n'est d'ailleurs pas l'esprit des traités européens. Et donc d'ailleurs, ne pas protéger les travailleurs ressortissants de pays tiers, c'est exposer tous les travailleurs, tous les travailleurs à toute forme d'exploitation, à toute forme de «dumping social». Parce qu'on sait très bien que, si on ne protège pas les travailleurs des pays tiers, eh bien les niveaux de protection pour les autres ne vont pas augmenter, bien au contraire, ils vont également baisser. Donc il ne peut pas y avoir dans cette Europe une place pour le dumping social. Et c'est pour cela que ce débat est important. C'est pour cela qu'il faut réfléchir dans quelle mesure et sous quelle forme on doit renforcer le rôle de l'AET. Et, fort de votre résolution, fort aussi du travail que fait la présidence belge, mais aussi sur la base du rapport d'évaluation que la Commission est en train de préparer et qui sera disponible au début du mois d'août, nous aurons clairement des indications sur quels moyens supplémentaires, juridiques et autres, doivent être donnés à l'AET pour qu'elle puisse correctement et encore mieux exercer sa fonction.",0,Nicolas Schmit,,membre de la commission,"Madam President, I believe that the day is well chosen to have a debate on the European Labor Authority.At the start of this session, we paid tribute to Jacques Delors, in his memory, but above all to his action.For him, the domestic market, which has been a lot cited, and free movement was not an end in itself.It is clear that for him he could not have worked there and free movement without a strong social dimension, without a high level of social protection of all workers.It was his wish.I admit that progress, and he also considered it in this way, that progress has sometimes been too slow.But we have managed to make progress, I simply recall, for example, the Department Directive.But we all know that the directives are useful, important, sometimes decisive, but what really matters is their implementation.And it is not the implementation after months and years of cases before the courts - and I do not decrease the importance of the courts.But when workers face, as was the case specific - but there are others, many other cases - with situations of social dumping, exploitation, refusal to see their paid wages, of conditionsUnacceptable work, etc., what they ask is an immediate implementation is an immediate reaction, it is being able to count on an instance that protects them.This is the objective of the AET.I must say - it was the previous commission chaired by my compatriot - that the AET has made changes.Today, we can discuss: if social protection must apply to nationals of third countries who come to Europe to work, if we can call into question their protection, the same rights to which they are entitled, it is notNot in the European spirit, it is not the spirit of Delors, it is not the spirit of European treaties.And therefore, moreover, not to protect workers from third countries is to exhibit all workers, all workers at any form of exploitation, to any form of ""social dumping"".Because we know very well that, if we do not protect workers from third countries, well the levels of protection for others will not increase, quite the contrary, they will also decrease.So there cannot be a place in this Europe for social dumping.And that is why this debate is important.This is why we must think to what extent and in what form we must strengthen the role of the AET.And, with your resolution, as well as work as the Belgian presidency, but also on the basis of the evaluation report that the commission is preparing and which will be available at the beginning of August, we will clearly haveIndications on what additional, legal and other means, must be given to the AET so that it can correctly and even better exercise its function."

Experts, representatives of local municipal authorities and of the social partners, stressed, in the hearing that we had, that the role of public procurement should be key in strengthening collective bargaining and social progress in the EU, and they pointed out the legal uncertainties of the current EU legislative framework on public procurement. Solutions that have been discussed in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee with our colleagues involved, first of all, revising the Public Procurement Directive so that there is an explicit push by public authorities to have no public contract without a collective agreement, clarifying that the promotion of collective bargaining with binding labour clauses does not violate EU law – and we had a big debate on that – revising the Public Procurement Directive to include mandatory social criteria, such as collective agreements, among others.

2024-01-15,20:44:37.102,20:55:05.000,628,"The role of social award criteria in public procurement in strengthening social rights, good working conditions and inclusive labour markets (debate)","Madam President, honourable Members, I would like to thank the Employment Committee for formulating these questions because, as you said now, the importance and the size of EU public procurement market is significant – 14 % of the EU GDP is spent every year by over 250 000 public authorities and entities to purchase goods and services, and to construct. This economic significance also means that public procurement is a powerful leveraging tool for spurring innovation and developing social and environmentally friendly solutions. Public procurement is also increasingly recognised as an important strategic economic policy tool to pursue policies, including in the sphere of social responsibility, and to shape our internal market and make it more efficient but also fair. The EU Public Procurement Directive, adopted in 2014, aimed at transforming public procurement from a process driven legalistic exercise to a genuinely relevant physical for delivering change in Europe. Our procurement rules do provide public buyers with greater flexibility to use public procurement as a strategic tool. Yet it is a reality that more contracts could be awarded based on quality criteria, supporting the green and social transition, and not only based on the lowest price. And recently, by the way, the Commission has recommended that in the field of green technologies, in the face of foreign competition that does not always respect all the rules, this is precisely the approach that has to be applied. This underlines not only the social aspect, but also the industrial and strategic aspect that has to be fully taken into account. Now, on your first question, the current EU public procurement directives do allow public authorities to ensure decent working conditions for the staff executing the contract in line with EU labour law. They also require economic operators to comply with all applicable EU or national labour obligations, including on collective agreements and bargaining during the performance of the contracts. The Commission has also developed several actions to provide guidance to the public authorities, in particular the Commission’s Buying Social Guide, published in May 2021, provides public buyers with clear and concrete guidance on how to make their procurement more socially responsible and to ensure compliance with labour law. And this also applies, by the way, to social enterprises, to give social enterprises also the possibility to be part of public procurement. The Commission has also launched the Big Buyers Working Together project to support collaboration between public buyers and to promote the wider use of strategic public procurement. This new project includes, inter alia, activities specifically relating to social procurement. It aims to build better understanding of the social, labour and ethical impact of public contracts, and how to use public procurement to achieve a positive impact in these areas. As to your second question, the ILO Convention No 94 is indeed not yet added to the list of ILO conventions in Annex X of Directive 2014/24 on public procurement. The reason for this is that the ILO conventions listed in this annex are part of the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and they have already been ratified by all EU Member States. The fundamental principles and rights at work have to be realised, respected and promoted by all members of the ILO. Grounds for amending the list in the annex are set out in Article 56 of the directive to add new international agreements that have been ratified by all Member States. However, as mentioned, Convention No 94 is not yet, hopefully, currently ratified by all Member States. In relation to measures to ensure compliance with the fundamental ILO conventions, the Directive on Public Procurement sets out that Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that in the performance of public contracts economic operators comply with applicable obligations in the fields of environmental, social and labour law established by Union law, national law, collective agreements or by the international environmental, social and labour law provisions listed in Annex X. I also want to refer that finally, it’s due to the European Parliament that there is a social clause in the Procurement Directive, and that also when we discussed about the Adequate Minimum Wage Directive, Parliament insisted on an as strong as possible Article 9 on the linkage between collective bargaining and especially adequate minimum wages and public procurement as a leverage finally to respect these provisions, but also to create a fair and level playing field because if some respect minimum wages or collective bargaining and others not, this is also finally falsifying competition when we are talking about public procurement. As to your third question on joint and several liability in subcontracting chains, the public procurement directives are not the sole legal framework relevant to the issue of strengthening social rights, good working conditions and inclusive labour markets. The proposal for a directive on corporate sustainability, due diligence, on which co-legislators recently achieved a political agreement, is relevant here. It will set obligations for large companies to address the actual and potentially adverse impacts on human rights and the environment, also with respect to the operations of their subsidiaries and those carried out by their business partners. The directive will also lay down conditions for triggering on penalties and civil liability for infringing those obligations. With regard to your fourth question on funding, the Commission has taken steps to ensure that Union funding promotes socially responsible procurement procedures. The financial regulation provides for a number of measures that secure the promotion of socially responsible public procurement by EU institutions. On this basis, social aspects, for example, related to social and professional inclusion and equality and gender-related considerations are taken into account in procurement procedures. As far as question five is concerned, public authorities have several means to support the upskilling and reskilling of workers. They can ask in the clauses related to contract execution to require upskilling and reskilling of workers when it is related to the subject matter of the contract. They can also include upskilling and reskilling of workers as a key performance indicator as part of the award criteria. The bid of the economic operator offering higher upskilling or reskilling would get a higher score and better position to win the tender. Finally, it is important to mention the ability of the Commission to monitor the procurement with social impact and to disseminate best practices to establish peer-to-peer learning. The Commission has launched important projects in this context. The new standard forms for uploading public procurement notices in the tender daily database will allow for better collection of procurement data on social procurement. With the public procurement data space, which will be operational this year, national governments will share information on procurement of lower value that are currently registered at a national level only. This will no doubt improve the quality of the data available. To conclude, public procurement in general is a powerful tool that can foster a more inclusive and equitable society and safeguard the rights of workers in public contracts. By using public procurement in a strategic way, public authorities can incentivise economic operators to adopt practices that preserve fundamental rights, enhance working conditions, promote upskilling, and foster inclusivity in the labour market. The European Commission has therefore supported and promoted this strategic approach to socially responsible public procurement through several initiatives that emphasise the integration of social considerations within public procurement practices across Member States.",0,Nicolas Schmit,,membre de la commission,"Madam President, honourable Members, I would like to thank the Employment Committee for formulating these questions because, as you said now, the importance and the size of EU public procurement market is significant – 14 % of the EU GDP is spent every year by over 250 000 public authorities and entities to purchase goods and services, and to construct. This economic significance also means that public procurement is a powerful leveraging tool for spurring innovation and developing social and environmentally friendly solutions. Public procurement is also increasingly recognised as an important strategic economic policy tool to pursue policies, including in the sphere of social responsibility, and to shape our internal market and make it more efficient but also fair. The EU Public Procurement Directive, adopted in 2014, aimed at transforming public procurement from a process driven legalistic exercise to a genuinely relevant physical for delivering change in Europe. Our procurement rules do provide public buyers with greater flexibility to use public procurement as a strategic tool. Yet it is a reality that more contracts could be awarded based on quality criteria, supporting the green and social transition, and not only based on the lowest price. And recently, by the way, the Commission has recommended that in the field of green technologies, in the face of foreign competition that does not always respect all the rules, this is precisely the approach that has to be applied. This underlines not only the social aspect, but also the industrial and strategic aspect that has to be fully taken into account. Now, on your first question, the current EU public procurement directives do allow public authorities to ensure decent working conditions for the staff executing the contract in line with EU labour law. They also require economic operators to comply with all applicable EU or national labour obligations, including on collective agreements and bargaining during the performance of the contracts. The Commission has also developed several actions to provide guidance to the public authorities, in particular the Commission’s Buying Social Guide, published in May 2021, provides public buyers with clear and concrete guidance on how to make their procurement more socially responsible and to ensure compliance with labour law. And this also applies, by the way, to social enterprises, to give social enterprises also the possibility to be part of public procurement. The Commission has also launched the Big Buyers Working Together project to support collaboration between public buyers and to promote the wider use of strategic public procurement. This new project includes, inter alia, activities specifically relating to social procurement. It aims to build better understanding of the social, labour and ethical impact of public contracts, and how to use public procurement to achieve a positive impact in these areas.

Wenn man sich den Instrumentenkasten des Europäischen Parlaments einmal ansieht, wie wir mit der Europäischen Kommission so umgehen können und Dinge ins Rollen bringen können, da ist die mündliche Anfrage ganz sicherlich nicht der dicke Hammer, sondern vielleicht mehr so ein kleiner Nagel oder eine Reißzwecke. Aber wer sich schon mal auf so eine Reißzwecke gesetzt hat, der weiß ja auch, dass die durchaus auch ihren Effekt haben kann. Und deswegen finde ich es richtig, dass wir heute bei dieser wichtigen Frage der öffentlichen Auftragsvergabe durchaus mal diese Reißzwecke hier auf den Stuhl des Kommissars legen. Nicht weil ich der Meinung bin, er hätte es persönlich verdient, sondern weil ich der Meinung bin, es für ein Versäumnis halte, dass die Europäische Kommission in dieser Legislaturperiode das Thema öffentliche Auftragsvergabe nicht angepackt hat – gleich aus zwei Gründen: Das eine ist natürlich der soziale Aspekt, gar keine Frage. Wir haben den europäischen Mindestlohn hier beschlossen, vorangebracht. Und natürlich ist die Frage Verknüpfung, Tarifbindung und öffentliche Auftragsvergabe ein ganz wesentliches Element, um für mehr Tarifbindung zu sorgen. Denn wir reden ja hier über öffentliche Gelder. Und natürlich ist es gerechtfertigt zu sagen – auch gerade in einer sozialen Marktwirtschaft: Wir wollen öffentliche Gelder in erster Linie an diejenigen vergeben, die sich auch an die Spielregeln der sozialen Marktwirtschaft halten. Aber der zweite Punkt, warum ich es für ein großes Versäumnis halte, ist die Frage der Nachhaltigkeit. Ich komme aus einem Stahlstandort im Ruhrgebiet, und wir haben oft die Diskussion: Wieso haben wir chinesischen Stahl in deutschen Autobahnbrücken und keinen Stahl aus Duisburg? Und die Antwort ist ganz einfach: Weil Stand heute Nachhaltigkeitsfragen dort keine Rolle spielen. Und ich finde, eine Institution wie die EU-Kommission, die den Grünen Deal so hoch aufgehangen hat, die muss auch dafür Sorge tragen, dass das bei der öffentlichen Auftragsvergabe in Zukunft eine Rolle spielt.",188945,Dennis Radtke,PPE,au nom du groupe,"Vice President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues!If you take a look at the European Parliament's instrument box, how we can handle the European Commission and can get things rolling, the oral request is certainly not the big hammer, but maybe more such a small nail or a zip purpose.But if you have ever sat on such a tear, you also know that it can also have its effect.And that's why I think it's right that today we put these zipes here on the chair of the commissioner with this important question of public order.Not because I believe that he would have deserved it personally, but because I think it is a failure that the European Commission did not tackle the topic of public order in this legislative period - for two reasons: One is naturalThe social aspect, no question at all.We decided to make the European minimum wage here.And of course the question of linking, collective bargaining and public order is a very important element in order to ensure more tariff bond.Because we talk about public funds here.And of course it is justified to say - especially in a social market economy: We primarily want public funds to those who also adhere to the rules of the game of the social market economy.But the second point why I think it is a big failure is the question of sustainability.I come from a steel location in the Ruhr area, and we often have the discussion: Why do we have Chinese steel in German motorway bridges and no steel from Duisburg?And the answer is very simple: because today sustainability issues were irrelevant.And I think that an institution like the EU Commission that has hung up the Green Deal so high must also ensure that this will play a role in public order."

Formand! Hvert år bruger offentlige institutioner i EU omkring 15 billioner kroner på offentlige indkøb. Desværre viser det sig igen og igen, at virksomhederne, som vinder disse udbud, ikke overholder grundlæggende arbejdstagerrettigheder. Det kan lade sig gøre, fordi EU reglerne i dag er totalt uklare på, hvad lokale myndigheder må stille af sociale og miljømæssige krav. Til gengæld er EU reglerne krystalklare om, at offentlige kontrakter skal tildeles efter laveste pris. Man skal ikke være et geni for at regne ud, at laveste pris uden klare sociale krav selvfølgelig skaber et ræs mod bunden på løn og arbejdsvilkår og en unfair konkurrence. Det er simpelt hen noget svineri. Offentlige midler skal ikke finansiere skattesvindel, social dumping og arbejdsmarkedskriminalitet. Det er derfor, at vi i Enhedslisten og venstrefløjsgruppen i EU-Parlamentet har taget initiativ til denne debat. Det er helt afgørende, at vi får revideret reglerne hurtigst muligt.

Notre but à l'époque était clairement de lutter contre le dumping social et la concurrence déloyale dans les marchés de travaux, mais aussi d'augmenter la qualité et l'efficacité des services aux citoyens, faciliter l'accès des marchés aux PME, garantir le respect des bonnes conditions de travail et des critères environnementaux. Après un long combat politique, le texte établissait notamment de manière claire que le critère pour les achats publics soit basé essentiellement sur la qualité et non plus systématiquement sur le prix le plus bas. C'est essentiel en matière de lutte contre le dumping social, mais bien sûr aussi en matière de conditions de travail, tout en garantissant aux citoyens un ouvrage bien effectué. Mais comme vous, j'ai lu les conclusions de la récente étude du Parlement européen sur l'impact social des marchés publics et constate avec beaucoup d'amertume qu'aujourd'hui encore, les pouvoirs publics sont confrontés à des obstacles juridiques et à des incertitudes lorsqu'ils tentent d'appliquer les critères d'attribution sociaux et environnementaux.

È assurdo che proprio le forze politiche che si dichiarano difensore dell'interesse nazionale non sostengano questa misura – infatti non stanno neanche partecipando al dibattito – permettendo così alle aziende non europee, che fanno del dumping sociale il loro principale strumento di competitività, di beneficiare dei nostri soldi pubblici facendo quindi concorrenza sleale e mettendo fuori gioco le imprese europee, quelle sane, oneste e rispettose della legge. È fondamentale ribadire la connessione evidente tra piccoli appalti pubblici e la loro maggiore capacità di controllo da parte degli enti pubblici rispetto ai mega-appalti, nei quali spesso si annidano, dietro il fumoso strumento del subappalto, le peggiori forme di abuso se non addirittura di infiltrazione della criminalità organizzata. L'accesso ad appalti pubblici di importi ridotti, infatti, sostengono le piccole imprese e gli artigiani del territorio, creando un legame forte con i cittadini e le comunità locali e diventando così benessere, prosperità e valore aggiunto per tutti. Da qui, quindi, nasce la nostra richiesta di rivedere la direttiva sugli appalti pubblici del 2014, perché solo così avremo uno strumento utile per la crescita dell'economia reale e una reale esigibilità delle tutele sociali e del lavoro.",197792,Daniela Rondinelli,S-D,,"Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner Schmit, honorable colleagues, I would like to ask the question of social conditionality in public procurement, which is an unavoidable condition to guarantee not only the European and national rules of labor law, but also a loyal competition in the context ofinternal market between European companies and among the latter and the companies of third countries operating on our continent.It is absurd that the political forces that declare themselves defender of the national interest do not support this measure - in fact they are not even participating in the debate - thus allowing non -European companies, which make social dumping their main tool of competitiveness, to benefit fromOur public money then making unfair competition and putting European, healthy, honest and respectful companies out of the law.It is essential to reiterate the evident connection between small public procurement and their greater control capacity by public bodies compared to mega-contracts, in which they often nest, behind the smoky surface of the subcontract, the worst forms of abuse if not ofinfiltration of organized crime.Access to public procurement of reduced amounts, in fact, support small businesses and artisans of the area, creating a strong bond with citizens and local communities and thus becoming well -being, prosperity and added value for everyone.From here, therefore, our request to review the 2014 public procurement directive is born, because only in this way will we have a useful tool for the growth of the real economy and a real collectability of social protections and work."

That’s clear. But does this mean that the price is the only indicator? Can our economies just function on the basis of price? You know, I was a labour minister and I was confronted several times with major labour work accidents. Probably these companies always were the best offering, lowest price. But then about working conditions. Well, they did not really respect them. Sometimes it went well and sometimes some workers just died or were hurt. And that’s why we cannot just base the spending of public money on one single criteria, which is price, because price is not a guarantee, as it was said for competition, at least not when we say fair competition. Because if you’re cheating, if you are not respecting labour rights, if you are not respecting protection of your workers, well, you will have the lowest price. But at what price? For whom? That’s why we have really to think how we create this balance, how we defend better the issue of social criteria. Environmental criteria is another one.

Questo è quanto è scritto, nero su bianco, all'articolo 174 del trattato sul funzionamento dell'Unione europea. Eppure in Italia sta avvenendo esattamente il contrario, Presidente. Con il definanziamento del Piano nazionale di ripresa e resilienza proprio per gli interventi che riguardavano il Sud; con lo svuotamento del Fondo di sviluppo e di coesione che avrebbe dovuto sostenere la sperequazione territoriale; con il blocco illegale dei fondi europei strutturali che sono destinati proprio alle regioni del Mezzogiorno; e con la sottrazione della spesa ordinaria a danno dei territori dei Sud per avvantaggiare ancora una volta quelli ricchi del Nord. Adesso il governo italiano sta per approvare una riforma che vuole concedere l'autonomia differenziata alle regioni più ricche per congelare definitivamente questa disuguaglianza, spaccando uno Stato membro e vanificando trent'anni di politica di coesione europea. Io dico che se la Commissione europea non interviene per fermare questa riforma vergognosa, vorrà dire che si renderà complice del governo italiano, che è un governo palesemente e profondamente razzista.",124844,Piernicola Pedicini,Verts/ALE,,"Mr. President, honorable colleagues, the Union aims to reduce the gap between the development levels of the various regions and the delay of the less favorite regions.This is what is written, black on white, in article 174 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union.Yet in Italy exactly the opposite, president.With the definition of the national recovery and resilience plan precisely for the interventions concerning the South;with the emptying of the development and cohesion fund that should have supported the territorial inequality;with the illegal block of European structural funds that are intended precisely to the regions of the South;And with the subtraction of ordinary expenditure to the detriment of the territories of the South to once again benefit those rich in the North.Now the Italian government is about to approve a reform that wants to grant the diverted autonomy to the richest regions to definitively freeze this inequality, splitting a Member State and frustrating thirty years of European cohesion policy.I say that if the European Commission does not intervene to stop this shameful reform, it will mean that it will become an accomplice of the Italian government, which is a clearly and deeply racist government."

Ils entendent ainsi protester contre la décision du gouvernement de supprimer la subvention diesel dont ils bénéficiaient jusque-là. Mais leur malaise est beaucoup plus profond. Ce qu'ils remettent en cause, au-delà de cette suppression, c'est la politique de l'Union européenne de libre-échange qui met leur activité en péril. Cette dimension européenne explique que les agriculteurs alsaciens leur aient apporté leur soutien. Elle explique aussi pourquoi, partout en France, les agriculteurs ont mis les panneaux des villes à l'envers depuis plusieurs semaines. C'est une bonne façon de signifier que l'Europe marche sur la tête. Trois reproches majeurs sont adressés à l'Union: sa politique de décroissance agricole, initiée par le programme de la ferme à la fourchette, ses traités de libre échange qui faussent la concurrence et ses exigences bureaucratiques déraisonnables.

Podnik sžírají finanční problémy způsobené prováděním nesmyslného Green Dealu, drahými energiemi a konkurenčním bojem vycházejícím ze zpackaného prodeje huti posvěceného Komisí, na jehož základě dostali přímí konkurenti huti Liberty Ostrava do rukou jeho hlavního a jediného dodavatele energií. Před lety, když GFG kupovala ostravskou huť od koncernu ArcelorMittal, řada odborníků upozorňovala, že vyjmutí jediného dodavatele energií Tameh a ponechání jej v rukou původního vlastníka je velmi špatný nápad, který ohrozí budoucnost české hutě. I přesto Komise tento prodej schválila. Dnes se vyplnily ty nejhorší scénáře a energie pro zásobování české huti se staly hlavním nástrojem konkurenčního boje dvou znesvářených koncernů.

Anders als von den USA habe ich von den Europäischen Institutionen hierzu nichts gehört. Erst vor zwei Jahren hat die EU die Entwicklungszusammenarbeit mit Burundi wieder aufgenommen.

Helaas deelt niet iedereen in Brussel diezelfde overtuiging. De voorzitter van de Europese Raad, Charles Michel, wordt namelijk lijsttrekker bij de Europese verkiezingen in juni. Zijn mandaat, de belangrijkste functie van de Unie, loopt echter nog tot november. Maar voor mijnheer Michel is het geen probleem, hij vertrekt gewoon vroeger. Met deze beslissing zet hij niet alleen zichzelf te kijk, maar ook de Europese Raad en de lidstaten die hem verkozen hebben. Laat hier geen misverstand over bestaan: we zijn hier getuige van plat opportunisme. Hij heeft als voorzitter weinig indruk gemaakt, dus uit vrees voor werkloosheid sorteert Michel alvast voor op het volgende Brusselse baantje. Dit doet het vertrouwen geen goed. Het zijn precies die momenten waarop de kiezers zich afvragen: wat voor zin heeft dit eigenlijk allemaal nog? Met ambitie is niets mis, maar bij Charles Michel gaat het persoonlijk belang overduidelijk voor op het publieke belang.",218349,Michiel Hoogeveen,ECR,,"Chairman, serving the public case is a great honor.Unfortunately, not everyone in Brussels shares the same conviction.The chairman of the European Council, Charles Michel, will be the leader in the European elections in June.His mandate, the most important function of the Union,, however, runs until November.But for Mr. Michel it is no problem, he just leaves earlier.With this decision he not only puts himself, but also the European Council and the Member States who have elected him.Let no misunderstanding about this: we are witnessed here of flat opportunism.As chairman, he has made little impression, so for fear of unemployment, Michel is already sorting for the next Brussels job.This is not good for confidence.It is precisely those moments when the voters wonder: what kind of sense does this actually have?Nothing is wrong with ambition, but with Charles Michel the personal interest is clearly ahead of the public interest."

Depuis cette date, de nombreuses entreprises utilisatrices de l'autoroute ferroviaire alpine sont à l'arrêt et subissent une perte allant jusqu'à 100 000 euros par mois. Tandis que les travaux devraient se terminer à la fin de l'année, une grande partie des salariés est déjà au chômage et les entreprises ne possèdent à ce jour aucune vision à long terme. Les banques ne suivent pas et aucune aide d'urgence n'est débloquée pour ces entreprises. Absolument rien n'est proposé alors qu'elles sont en train de tout perdre. Certaines partiront en liquidation dans quelques semaines si rien n'est fait. Alors que les travaux du Lyon-Turin coûteront plusieurs milliards d'euros à l'Union européenne, il est impératif d'agir sans attendre pour aider les professionnels du ferroutage qui n'existeront plus lorsque la ligne verra enfin le jour.",236050,Marie Dauchy,ID,,"Mr. President, on October 27, a massive landslide of ten thousand cubic meters of rock took place in the Praz sector, cutting all the road and rail traffic lanes of Haute Maurienne, as well as the main border crossing pointBetween Italy and France.Since that date, many companies using the Alpine railway highway have been stopped and have a loss of up to 100,000 euros per month.While the work should end at the end of the year, a large part of employees is already unemployed and companies have no long -term vision to date.Banks do not follow and no emergency aid is unlocked for these companies.Absolutely nothing is proposed when they are losing everything.Some will go into liquidation in a few weeks if nothing is done.While the work of Lyon-Turin will cost the European Union several billion euros, it is imperative to act without delay to help the ferrouping professionals who will no longer exist when the line will finally see the light of day."

Asistentke, asistenti v pisarnah evropskih poslank in poslancev so steber in gonilna sila našega delovanja ter nenadomestljiva podpora pri uresničevanju naših političnih ambicij.

Ich weiß nicht, aus welcher Zeit diese Regelung stammt, aber ich plädiere wirklich dafür, dass wir das ändern.
